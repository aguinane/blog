Rachael is doing her final nursing placement in [Boonah](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Boonah+QLD+4310/). So prior to the placement we went for a drive to see what the town and surrounding areas were like last October.

The drive through [Cunningham's Gap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunninghams_Gap) is spectacular. The western side is rainforest, and the eastern side provides views of some really steep sections of the great dividing range. There is a nice rainforest walk at the very top, but unfortunately the lookout that you walk to doesn't have a very good view.

On our first trip we found [Lake Moogerah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moogerah_Peaks_National_Park), which you are allowed to swim in. It was a stinking hot day and we didn't bring togs so we made sure we did the next time, but unfortunately the water wasn't as inviting the second time.

We tried to take a scenic way back to Toowoomba through Spicer's Gap and see [Governor's Chair Lookout](http://www.nprsr.qld.gov.au/parks/main-range/about.html#tracks_around_spicers_gap) but the road is actually closed to cars at the top and so you can't drive through. It was a good lookout, but the road was very steep and dangerous especially in a Yarris (and not a 4WD) and so it wasn't really worth the effort, as you have to backtrack back down.

Boonah itself wasn't all that exciting, although the area is full of rolling green hills which are pretty nice.
