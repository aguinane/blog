The flight was extremely long, and horribly uncomfortable. Thai airways was an awesome airline though, everything was very schmick but it didn't change the fact that you had to sit in the same spot for 8 hours.

Bangkok airport was pretty cool, the place was massive. As it was night time it was hard to tell how big exactly since you couldn't see outside, but it seemed to go on forever. Also they had stores selling elephant tusks, which I thought was frowned upon, but I guess not.

The flight with Swiss Airways wasn't as fancy but I spent most of it trying to sleep so it wasn't a huge deal.

Zurich airport was pretty cool too. They had a [train between terminals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skymetro) and they had all these posters along the track which, because we were going so fast, made stop-motion videos of a lady waving a Swiss flag.

Getting through customs was easy too, they didn't even check our bags, just the passport. From the airport I got a train to [Zürich Hauptbahnhof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich_Hauptbahnhof), then on to Turgi, where I walked across to ABB and got shown to my accommodation.
