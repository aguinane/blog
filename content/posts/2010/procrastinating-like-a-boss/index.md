![Bridge](P1020706.jpg "")

So I had planned to do uni work this weekend, got next to nothing done.

Here's some of the photos that were taken in the name of procrastination.

I went for a walk up the mountain on the opposite side of Turgi this time.

The photo of me standing over a sheer cliff below looks a bit lame
when you can't see the cliff...
