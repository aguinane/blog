![01](01.jpg)

Yet another year where I was slack with listening to new music. On the other hand, I did get to go to a fair few live gigs throughout the year. The Spotted Cow has been good for that, hopefully they have just as many bands come through this year. Yet again I tied to keep one vote per artist, which meant that a couple of like a versions made it in. I'm picking Get Lucky or Royals for #1, but Giorgio By Moroder and Team beat them out when I was deciding what sounded better tonight. Perhaps that's just due to overplaying.

My votes:

* Daft Punk - Giorgio By Moroder
* Lorde - Team
* Franz Ferdinand - Love Illumination
* Illy - Ausmusic Month Medley {Like A Version}
* Tame Impala - Prototype {Like A Version}
* Abbe May - Pony {Like A Version}
* Hungry Kids Of Hungary - Do Or Die
* Bluejuice - S.O.S.
* Haim - Falling
* The Cat Empire - Prophets in the Sky
