She was the second youngest of 7, her siblings being her sister Joyce and brothers Billy, Bobby, George, Jackie and Jim. She always went by Isabel. In fact, she wasnât even aware that her first name was legally Jean until her wedding day when the government made her redo the paperwork because her name was âwrongâ.\nIsabel went to Frenchville State School, as did her three kids and three of her grandchildren. It was a bit different then compared to the Frenchville of today. During the 2nd world war they had to practice jumping into trenches that had been dug on the school oval when the practice air raid sirens sounded. They also had to write with pen and ink, and one day she blotted ink on her page and the punishment for this was she got the cane across her fingers from the headmaster.\nIsabel enjoyed playing hockey in her younger years but ended up getting hit in the mouth with a hockey stick... smashing a number of her front teeth out and having to get dentures. She told us that she wanted to play rugby league as well but her father didnât think that it was a game for girls to play.\nShe left school at 12 years of age (as girls were not expected to attend high school then) taking up a job at Ricketts Bakery. She talked about wanting to be a nurse, but was told by her father that âgood girlsâ didnât become nurses.\nAt around 18 she made the brave move with her best friend Bev to Brisbane to conquer âthe big smokeâ. They stayed with her Auntie Winnie but returned to Rocky having had enough of âthe big smokeâ, only two weeks later.\nIsabel and Brian met at a local dance and loved dancing so much they kept it up for a lot of their life together. They would sometimes practise their dance steps when they were much much older, pushing all the living room furniture to the sides of the room so they had their own miniature ballroom to dance in. They liked to catch the train to Emu Park on the weekends,  sometimes jumping on without paying just as the train was leaving. Brian talks of how she used to enjoy riding around with him on his motorbike, once crashing into the back of a car on the Fitzroy River Bridge. Even after this she still bravely enjoyed getting on the back.\nOn the 7th June 1958, they got married at St Andrews church on what Brian describes as a very rainy day, fortunately not a bad omen for their long and happy marriage. This year they celebrated their 62nd anniversary, something that they were very proud of.\nRoss was born in 1959, followed by Graeme 2 years later, and finally Lorelle another 2 years after that. The family briefly lived in Eagle Junction and Margate while Brian did work training for the Postmaster General Department, but they spent most of their lives in Rockhampton.\nIsabel's life was full as a wife and mother looking after the three children and being involved with her wider family and friends and neighbours. The neighbourhood families enjoyed getting together regularly for barbeques at each other's houses and social sport, with the kids racing around being carefree as they were in those days. Her and the kids would often walk to visit her sister Joyce and family cutting through the creek and bush before the houses were built. Only a few weeks ago while reminiscing, Isabel said that she still sometimes really missed her mum and sister.\nShe was always there for her kids. School holidays were often spent down at the creek catching tadpoles and guppies, neighbourhood kids always in tow. Or catching the bus into town to do some shopping or going to the movies.\nShe was always able to go to all the school sports days and anything else happening at the school as well as helping out at the tuckshop. Lorelle remembers these days fondly as it was the only time she, Ross and Graeme were allowed tuckshop. They usually got a pie and a chocolate Bi-Jingo - 12 cents for a pie and 8 cents for the ice-cream. She also volunteered at the Kindergarten just around the corner and also later at a childcare centre on the southside of town. She always loved kids.\nLorelle has shared the following memory: âMum liked to sew and would make clothes for herself and I. There was always an endless number of birthday parties through primary school and one of the girls at school was being catty about how I always turned up to parties wearing the same two dresses. I went home to Mum crying about it and so the next day she went out and bought material and a dress pattern and sat up all night to make me a new dress for the party the following day. I remember feeling so good because I was the best dressed girl at the party.â\nAfter Brian retired in 1993 they moved to Emu Park. Isabel had 7 grandkids, and she would always have her cupboard stocked with lollies and biscuits for when they visited on school holidays or weekends. Every year we would have Christmas with all the Wheatlands at Emu Park and grandma would make her famous trifle, and in later years her white chocolate cheesecake.\nWe have fond memories of grandma teaching us to play checkers, and card games like go fish and switch. If we stayed at the beach we would always go to her place for breakfast, because sheâd let us watch cartoons on TV.\nIn their retirement, Isabel and Brian did many bus tours travelling all around Australia. Isabel played social tennis, continued her love of dancing with Brian, as well as Tai chi and line dancing.\nShe loved her Rugby League, and was a Parramatta fan for many years until the Cowboys and  her beloved Jonathon Thursten entered the competition. She loved State of Origin and was able to attend a few games at Suncorp Stadium as well as a Test match between Australia and New Zealand and several Broncos games. She was very happy that she was able to see the entire game last Wednesday night on TV and see her beloved Queensland win the first game of the series..\nShe loved to read, mainly murder mysteries and biographies of her rugby league favourites. She also loved puzzles and crosswords (especially cryptic) and would do them daily. She said it was helping her brain stay sharp, and it worked because right to the end her mind was as sharp as a tack.\nIsabel passed away on Saturday morning the 7th November at the Rockhampton Mater hospital. We would like to thank the wonderful medical staff at St. Andrews War Memorial Hospital Brisbane, especially Dr Alex Incarni and Dr Andrew Cartmill and the staff at Rockhampton Mater.\nShe will be greatly missed and remembered as a loving wife, mother, grandmother, great grandmother, sister, aunt and friend. She will live on forever, as she has left us all with many stories and memories of her love.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/pages/eulogy-isabel-wheatland/","title":"Eulogy for Isabel Wheatland"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/pages/eulogy-marie-guinane/":{"body":"The following is a copy of the eulogy read by Gary Guinane at Marie's funeral on 19 Oct 2020.\nMARIE THERESE GUINANE was born in Rockhampton on the 28th July 1934 the 2nd daughter of Frank &amp; Jean Close. She was one of 12 children born to them.\nMarie was educated at St Josephs School Park Avenue and Dingo State Schools. Most of her childhood was spent on the family dairy farm at Dingo where Marie and her siblings carried out various chores associated with life on a farm including hand milking the cows twice a day.\nThe family were told various stories from this time including Uncle Mick falling off the back of the milk cart and she drove off thinking he was mucking around but later found out he had really injured himself badly also riding a horse to go to school and always running late for class.\nThe family later moved to 8 Buckle Street Park Avenue but Marie stayed on and worked as a governess on Mckenzies \"Alsace\" Station in Dingo. On returning to Rockhampton she worked as a cadet nurse at the Mater Hospital where she nursed a certain Kevin Guinane. We don't know if was love at first sight but it certainly blossomed into love for life.\nThey married on the 6th November 1954 and set up home at 12 Harbourne St Koongal and went on to have their 6 children Gary, Karen, Jenny, Kevin Jnr, Trevor and the baby of the family Carmel.\nAs you can see by the size of the brood Maries life was mostly then spent as a mother and home carer. Marie and Kevin's family was quite often extended when various nieces and nephews came to stay whilst their parents convalesced at the local hospitals.\nOnce the majority of the family had left home Marie, Kevin and Carmel spent as much time as possible travelling around Australia and Carmel had a holiday at Auntie Carols place whilst they visited New Zealand.\nThe family grew once more when grandchildren started to arrive, 12 in all. Marie enjoyed helping with babysitting whenever she was needed and loved the large family gathering for birthdays and at Christmas.\nMarie was envious of her siblings that had great grandchildren and told us she was going nowhere until she had some of her own,\nShe was overjoyed when her own arrived and now there are 12 in all.\nSome of the happiest times of her life were the time she spent with the family and its a wonderful testament to her that all of her grandchildren are in attendance today.\nSadly Kevin passed in 2007 and Marie relocated to 102/19 Schuffenhauser St where she spent the rest of her days. Unfortunately the last 18 months of her life was plagued by on going health problems, the last of which results in us all being here today.\nFor the last days of her life Marie was surrounded by many members of her family and passed away peacefully in the early hours of the morning of 13th October.\nThe family would like to express their gratitude for the care given to their Mother, Grandmother and Great Grandmother by Doctors Hendricks, Rau and Koudri and the nursing staff of the Mater hospital, Bethany and OZ Care.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/pages/eulogy-marie-guinane/","title":"Eulogy for Marie Guinane"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/pages/power-engineering/":{"body":"It can be hard to explain what I do for work without having a basic understanding of a bunch of power engineering concepts.\nSo this post is an attempt at that.\nA disclaimer that the below all represents my personal opinions and understandings and does not represent that of my employer or any other organisations.\nRatings\nWhen you run electricity through things they get hotter - the more energy the hotter it can get.\nPower lines are essentially a bit of a wire strung between two poles.\nJust like any metal, when it gets hot it expands and cause the wire to get longer and 'sag'.\nThere are rules about how low they can get by sagging before they are a safety issue.\nThis is to prevent things like trucks or cars hitting them, or someone being able to come into contact with it some other way if it's not near a road.\n\nEventually, if you went way above the rating the wires would melt and fall to the ground.\nSo there is a maximum amount of power that can safely flow through the lines before they have a safety issue, which is called the rating.\nAs ratings are due to the wire heating up, they can change throughout the year based on weather conditions (it's colder on a winter night, then a summer evening and so they can handle more energy).\nTransformers and other electrical equipment are often full of oil and if the oil gets too hot it can catch fire or arc, and so transformers also have a maximum amount of power they can handle.\nOne good thing about thermal ratings is that generally things can take a while to heat up (maybe a few hours) so very short periods going slightly above the maximum value can be okay.\nIf the power being used is getting close to the rating, you either need to reduce the power being used or put in bigger wires or transformers that can handle more heat.\nProtection\nTo prevent wires falling to the ground, or transformers catching fire, there are things called protection devices that will turn the power off before this happens.\nOther safety issues, like a power line falling to the ground or a lightning strike, will generally produce a fault current that is much higher then the rating and will cause the protection to trip the power off.\nGenerally the protection thresholds are set slightly lower then the rating, so that power will trip off before things get damaged or there are safety concerns.\nThings that aren't faults can cause large spikes in power though, (like in the UK where everyone turns their kettle on at half time of a football match).\nSo the protection limit needs to be set such that it does not turn off the power for actual loads, but does for any faults.\nThe circuit breakers in your house switchboard does the same thing, which is why sometimes the safety switch will trip when using an dodgy iron.\nOr if you have two many appliances running on a circuit at the same time it will exceed the breaker's rating and trip.\n\nAnother way to avoid turning off the power unnecessarily is something called an 'auto-reclose'.\nThis is when a fault is detected and the protection device gives it a few seconds to try and go away by itself.\nAn example would be a lightning strike or tree branch falling on a line.\nThe hope is that if you wait a few seconds and try to turn the power back on everything might have fixed itself.\nLightning only lasts a split-second and in the case of the tree branch it would have caught fire and fallen away.\nThat's why sometimes in storms the lights will flicker off and on a few times, but hopefully the power stays on.\nIf the fault is still detected after a few reclose attempts, it is probably something more serious (like a fallen line) and so it needs to be turned off permanently until someone can physically make the area safe and fix the problem.\nPower Quality\nAnother thing that can limit how much power can flow through the grid is power quality.\nTo explain electricity, water pipes are often used as an analogy.\nFor voltage, this is analogous to the water pressure.  Similar to how you do not want water pressure to be too strong or weak when having a shower, there is a sweet spot. In order to prevent damage to equipment it needs to be kept in a certain range - if the voltage gets too high or low it can cause damage to appliances. In particular, high volts will make things run slightly hotter and therefore not last as long. If you look at the label on a phone charger for example, it will say what voltage range it can work with (probably 100-240 V). In Australia, the preferred voltage range that power should be supplied to your house is 225-244 V.\nBelow is an example of the voltage at our house throughout the day and how it changes based on how much power we are using at the time.\nIt also varies when we aren't using any power, as your neighbours are all sharing the same network and so they can also impact it.\n\nGenerating power (exporting solar) pushes the voltage up, and consuming power brings the voltage down. Looking at my peak day example above, the voltage started at about 236 V. When the solar came on it pushed the voltage up 4 V to 240 V and then when the air con came on it dropped 8 V to 232 V (and the solar was still helping to push it up). The relationship between power and voltage can depend on where in the network the power is coming from - the transformer is right out the front of my house and the further from the transformer your house is the bigger the impact on the voltage, so it didn't vary that much. So sometimes the hosting capacity will be limited not by a thermal rating but by the power being so high (or low) that it causes voltages to be outside the preferred range and starting to cause damage to appliances.\nDemand and Diversity\nIn my switchboard, the main safety switch has a rating of 63 A.\nBut adding up how much some (not even all) of the appliances in our house can use, gives a total power of 111 A.\nApplianceAmpereskilo Watts\nAir Con255.8\nOven225.1\nHot Water System153.5\nInduction Cooktop (Main Plate)153.5\nInduction Cooktop (2nd plate)81.8\nClothes Dryer102.3\nKettle92.1\nToaster40.9\nTV10.2\nComputer10.2\nChest Freezer10.2\nTotal11125.6\n\nThis possible because of something called diversity - where hopefully you are not running every single load in your house at the exact same time.\nIn a another post, I did some analysis of our home energy usage. If you look at my usage over the course of a year, you can see that for most of the year we use barely any power (&lt;1 kW). In daytime we are mostly exporting power to the grid up to the 5 kW size of our rooftop solar. For a very small percentage of the year we are using 4-8 kW if the air conditioning is particularly working hard.\nThe below chart is called a load duration curve and shows what percentage of the year was at a given power flow.\nThe highest part of the curve is called the maximum demand.\nThe lowest part of the curve is called is called the minimum demand (in my case it is negative since we are exporting solar).\n\nA good example of these rare extremes was when we came home from holidays on a cold winter day at about lunch time.\nThe hot water had been turned off while we were away and pretty much the only power being used was the fridge and chest freezer.\nWe went from a power flow of -5 kW exporting from the solar to importing 8 kW from the grid when I turned on the hot water and started blasting the air conditioning to warm up the house (which means we were actually using about 13 kW as some was fed by the solar).\nIf we had needed to cook some lunch on the induction cook top and oven at the same time (which is up to 8 kW in short bursts) we would probably have tripped off the power to the house.\nOr, if we had an electric car and wanted to charge it after our trip (another 3 - 8 kW depending on charging speed) that would have put it over the limit also.\n\nLuckily, it's rare that everything wwould run at the same time like this though.\nEven on hot days when you might run the air-con all day, in reality it's turning on and off throughout the day.\nAir-con has a thermostat and so will only turn on when the room temperature is above whatever it is set to.\nThe rest of the time the air-con is turned off.\nIt is the same for fridges, hot water etc they just turn on and off throughout the day as needed to get the temperature right.\nThe expected After-Diversity Maximum Demand (ADMD) for Queensland households is 5 kVA 1 - which means whilst people might use more then that for very short periods, on average the most houses use at any one time (on  average) is 5 kVA even on really hot days.\nUnfortunately, there is no such diversity for solar because generally if the sun is shining for you (or cloudy), it is for all your neighbours as well and always at the same time of the day.\n1\nAccording to the [Ergon Energy Developers Handbook][ergonadmd]\n[ergonadmd]: https://www.ergon.com.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/1020490/Developers-Handbook-Developers-Design-and-Construct-Work-14340283.pdf\n\nLooking at 10 peaky days for our house, you can see the time of the load peaks varies pretty wildly (but not so much for solar generation).\n\nFor all of Queensland, the maximum demand usually occurs on really hot summer days when everyone is using their air conditioning at the same time.\nIn colder places like Toowoomba it might be a winter morning peak with everyone running heating.\nThe minimum demand is usually when all the rooftop solar is generating (no clouds) but nobody is using any power - generally Spring and Autumn long weekends (nobody is at work), when temperatures are pleasant (so no air con), but there is plenty of sun.\nDiversity means that you don't see sudden spikes like you would for a single house as you get higher up in the grid.\nLooking at the state wide load duration curve for Queensland in the Powerlink TAPR, the peaks are only for a small amount of the year.\nThe minimum demand occurs much more often then maximum demand, since solar is less diverse, and is getting lower (and for longer) each year as more people install solar.\nEnergy Transition\nThe Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) forecasts in their Integrated System Plan a large increase in rooftop solar, batteries and EV charging in the next few decades. The amount of solar has been doubling every 3 years.\nElectic Vechile (EV) sales are increasing at a similar rate, and an EV fast charger basically doubles the capacity a normal house uses (32 A or 7.3 kW), so is pretty significant.\nOne solution to support this would be to upgrade the ratings of the grid to support this by doubling the amount of transformers and substations - but this would cost billions of dollars. A significantly cheaper option is to instead just make sure that car charging soaks up all the solar power, and does not happen at the same time as air conditioning. Like with the pandemic, we want to 'flatten the curve'.\nDevice Control\nOccasionally, power need to be switched off because there is not enough generation, like when a power station suddenly goes offline. On the flip side, generation might need to be turned off if nobody is using any load to make use of it - this video gives a good example. In Australia, this is done by AEMO issuing something called a Lack of Reserve Notice (LOR) or Minimum System Load (MSL) Notice.\nThe ability to switch circuits on and off on a schedule has been a think since the 50s using something called ripple control.\nIf you put certain devices (like hot water or pool pumps) on an economy tariff, you get cheaper electricity rates in return for the network operator being able to turn them off for a few hours on days of peak usage.\nFor hot water systems, nobody really notices if they are turned off for short periods as they are essentially a thermal battery and can store heat.\nIn fact, they can be used like a normal battery to soak up solar in the day and then you can use the hot water for showers at night.\nAll you really care about is that the water is hot when you want to use it.\nFor most other appliances you do care that you can use it when you want to as they don't act like a battery.\nIt doesn't make sense to put air conditioning on an economy tariff as hot days is exactly when you want to use it.\nThere was an improvement to ripple control in 2007 in the form of the AS4755 Demand Response standard.\nIt allowed other options other then just turning things off completely.\n\nDRM0: disconnect\nDRM1: compressor off\nDRM2: capped to operate at 50%\nDRM3: capped to operate at 75%\n\nBut most people don't really like someone having control even though it's better for everyone's air con to go to 50% then the power to the street to trip off completely at times of maximum demand.\nA similar problem with solar occurs at times of minimum demand, which is referred to as emergency backstop and also not a very popular idea desite being needed to as an emergency mechanism to a system blackout.\nDynamic Pricing\nWhy can't this all be solved by or time-of-use tariffs or dynamic prices instead? These definitely can help with the problem but fall short of solving it completely for a couple of reasons.\nWe are on a time-of-use tariff, and try to do things like pre-cooling the house to avoid needing to run the air-con during the peak period. But if the temperature gets hot enough - we will run the air-con no matter what the price is.\nAnother way that pricing falls short is that it's generally set a statewide level. There may be little pockets around the state that have a constraint and have an opposing requirement to the statewide one. An example might be that some sort of event is happening that results in a large amount of people visiting a small town (like Roma or Birdsville Races) and despite being a nice sunny day with cheap prices due to lots of solar, the local part of the grid does not have a capacity for everyone to fast charge their EVs simultaneously.\nHosting Capacity\nThe distribution grid hosting capacity is defined as the amount of new generation or consumption that can be accommodated by the grid without adversely impacting the reliability or power quality for other customers or requiring grid upgrades or modifications.\nAnyone who connects to the electricity grid and receives a fixed connection is guaranteed their part of this available capacity forever in a first come, first served (whoever first calls dibs) system. Generally there is a basic connection offer that anyone can apply for that is free upfront (money comes out of power bills later) even if the network requires upgrades to support it. There is also a negotiated process for larger customers who want more then the basic offering where they might need to pay some of the upgrade cost upfront if upgrades are required to unlock more capacity.\nAccording to the Ergon Connection Policy the basic fixed offering in urban Queensland is currently 100 A (23 kVA) per phase for loads, and 22 A (5 kVA) per phase for generation (solar).\nSo if you want more power then this and there is no capacity available, you are required to pay for some of the upgrade costs (which could be very expensive). The reason why the value for loads is higher then generation is due to loads being more diverse then solar as discussed earlier. There is an assumption that not everyone will use all their appliances at the same time, but they will all generate solar at the same time.\nIn the case of solar, when there is no capacity left there might be an option to connect for free but not be allowed to export to the grid. This is so that people without solar aren't forced to pay for the upgrade costs in their bills for those that do, but does still mean they might miss out if they want to add solar later. If for example, there was a 100 kW transformer on a street, and everyone can automatically apply for a 5 kW solar system, the first 20 people on the street to install solar are allowed to export indefinitely, but everyone after that is not allowed to export as there is no spare capacity left without installing a new transformer (which is expensive).\nThe problem with a fixed hosting capacity number, is that is needs to be conservative and assume the worst-case conditions into the future. It only really applies on minimum demand days, but the rest of the year it may be possible for the grid to handle way more then that.\nDynamic Operating Envelopes\nIf we dynamically calculate the hosting capacity every 5 minutes instead of using a single worst-case figure for the entire year, we unlock heaps of extra capacity for free for ~95% of the time. In theory, calculating this dynamic hosting capacity is relatively easy, it's the real-time rating (factoring in weather conditions) minus the real-time power usage (what power are people using right now). In practice, it's usually not that easy - there isn't real time data for weather and power usage at every point in the network so a bunch of complex calculations and assumptions need to be made to try and work it out.\nSending the grid limits is a big improvement over direct control over appliances as a customer. Instead of turning of having the network turn off a specific device - a Home Energy Management System (or HEMS) can make these decisions for you. On min demand days, if the grid wants you to stop exporting solar instead of it turning off and wasting generation, you could instead charge your EV or run the air con to pre-cool your house. On max demand days, if the grid wants you to stop importing energy you could power your air con from your battery instead. Or if you do need to turn something off you can make the choice about whether your air con or EV charging is more important at that moment.\nDynamic Operating Envelopes (DOE) over the internet is one solution to this. Basically the HEMS receives an Import and Export Limit (in kW) every 5 minutes for that site. It works a little bit like a variable speed limit sign on the motorway that might say it's 100 km/h normally but will drop down to 60 km/h if there has been an accident or congestion.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/pages/power-engineering/","title":"Power Engineering"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/":{"body":"","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/","title":"Posts"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/":{"body":"","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/","title":"2010"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/007-bungee-jump-verzasca-dam/":{"body":"\nOn Monday afternoon I did the 007 Bungee Jump off the Verzasca Dam.\nWe caught a train to Tenero then hiked up towards the Dam. When I first saw it way in the background I thought - that is huge. But once we got close the nerves dissapeared and I was just excited mostly.\nWe had to wait for a fair while before we could do our jump because there was a film crew filming for a German travel show. But at least we got to see someone do the jump before any of us did it.\nIt is 220m from the platform to the ground, and the actual jump is like 180m I was told. And it is the same jump as from the opening scene of the movie Goldeneye, hence the name.\nI was chatting to the guy at the top of the platform and he had been living in Noosa for a while. He asks everyone how they are feeling and when I told him I wasn't nervous but felt like I should be, he told me it was his first day working there to try and help me out. I assume it was a joke but you never know, I suppose it always has to be your first day once.\nIt is a looooooong way to the bottom but it didn't feel like it. When I jump at first I just felt shock at not touching anything, then a feeling sort of like you get from the Giant Drop, then by the time I started to enjoy the fact that I was free-falling it was over. I think the freefall is 4 seconds, and it's over way too fast to fully appreciate it. Skydiving next time for sure.\nThe jerk of the rope was quite a shock and not as smooth as I thought it would be, but doesn't hurt. I then started to think \"Oh it's over...\" before you bounce back up again and get to experience zero-gravity at the top of the bounce where it feels like you are floating. Definitely the coolest part of the jump in my opinion. The bounce back down again you feel all the blood rush to your head, and then it's pretty much over because the next couple of bounces are way smaller.\nThen the guys yell out to pull yourself up (it's surprising how well you can hear them considering how far up they are). And you have to pull on a rope to flip yourself up the right way. That bit was a little bit scary trying to work out which is the right rope to pull while upside down.\nThen they lower down a winch cable, pull you up and it's all over.\nDefinitely an amazing experience, and I would go again. Although it wasn't quite as exhilarating as I thought it would be, and the adrenalin didn't last very long afterwards. After seeing how pumped Adrian still was a few hours after I was expecting it to last longer than 5mins or so, but that's about all it lasted.\nSome photos below, but more photos and some videos that other people took on facebook as well.\n5 Stars.\n(Everyone in Aus should watch the show Review, it started a new series a few weeks ago but I can't watch it from here due to the ABC blocking out people from Switzerland).\n\nTravel show filming and jump\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/007-bungee-jump-verzasca-dam/","title":"007 Bungee Jump - Verzasca Dam"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/a-dissapointing-trip-in-to-zurich/":{"body":"\nToday I went to ZÃ¼rich with Anthony to make my own pocketknife at the Landesmuseum, but when we got there they told us they were totally booked up for the whole day, so we couldn't :(\nSo we walked around the city in the rain for a bit, but nothing too exciting. There really isn't too much to see in ZÃ¼rich in comparison to some of the other places around. And especially when it's raining.\nThe GrossmÃ¼nster did have some cool stained-glass windows though (above). Rather than just using glass they had all these cool gemstone things. It said no photography allowed, but I took some photos anyway. The view from the top of the tower was okay as well, but climbing the tower at Bern and Basel were better.\nIn the end the rain got to us, so we went home early, forgoing the option of free transport after 7 with the Gleis7 and paying to go home at around 2.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/a-dissapointing-trip-in-to-zurich/","title":"A dissapointing trip in to ZÃ¼rich"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/alpamare/":{"body":"\nYesterday I went to Alpamare with some people staying at our flat for New Year (family of Nelly). It is basically like Wet-n-Wild except mostly indoor, which is good considering there was snow in the outdoor parts.\nThe slides were incredible fun, I enjoyed it much more than Wet-n-Wild. One slide called the Thriller was completely pitch-black for the whole way which was kind of scary the first time as the turns and drops came out of nowhere.\nThe one's that were outside were crazy. The Cresta Canyon was probably one the best and started inside, then went outside WHERE IT WAS FREEZING then came back inside again at the end. The outside parts had all the mist coming off the water as well due to the temperature loss which was cool looking. There was another one called Balla Balla that took around 45 seconds, which is a long time considering how fast it was.\nAfter the slides we went to the outdoor pool, which is a strange experience considering the water is warm and yet on the sides of the pool there is snow. And the whole time this mist comes off the water due to the heat and you can't see much in front of you. Being at night it gave everything a cool eery look. There was also a pool that wasn't heated, and was around 5Â°C. Next to it was an Iodine Brine Bath which was 36Â°C. Jumping in and out of the two was the strangest feeling. When I jumped into the cold pool my body felt like it had erupted into goose-bumps. And then when getting back into the heated pool the water burnt a little, like your feet sometimes do in a hot shower on a cold day.\nIt was certainly an interesting experience.\nOh and there are no photos because one of the staff yelled at me for having a camera.

And I somehow walked into a natural history museum, which was also cool.\nIt was a reasonably hot day, and there was lots of people at the public swimming pool (which is free apparently), and swimming in the river. There was also tonnes of tourists like myself, I guess because\nit was a weekend.\n\nThis house had an elevator garage-thing, and they were waiting for it to drop down so they could drive the car on top.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI seriously thought the people in the below photo were real for like half a second. In fact, most the houses and buildings around here have really cool murals and stuff painted on them.\n\nThere was steps like this all along the river, with handrails to get in and out.\n\n\nThere was lots of people at the swimming pool, and also in the river.\n\nThis apparently is the Einstein Museum. I have no idea what that means because it isn't open Sundays.\n\n\nSam, in response to your comment on one of the other posts, I haven't tried any real Swiss chocolate yet. I've only bought stuff from the shops. They have different brands to us (and some the same) but other than that they are about the same, although definitely a bigger range. The chocolate in this shop looked amazing, but it was closed. And also probably very expensive.\n\nGroup of tourists on a tour....\n\nThis guy had mad-skills, and was walking along this cable tied to the bridge. Then he did it backwards.\n\n\n\nI spent ages looking for some free water, and ended up buying some bottled water (for like the 2nd time in my life). I read briefly on the net that you could drink from these public fountains, but was dubious about it and didn't see anyone else doing it. I looked it up on the net since though and  apparently they are all okay to drink unless there is a sign saying otherwise.\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/bern/","title":"Bern"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/berner-munster/":{"body":"\nWhile in Bern, I went inside this amazing looking church, The MÃ¼nster of Bern.

We got to meet a diverse range of people during the trip. Immediately opposite Rachael and I was a British couple. I don't think I heard the girl say a word during the whole journey. She sat there for the whole trip with headphones in ear, basically ignoring our existence. The guy was a polar opposite, extremely chatty and engaged us in conversation for the entire trip. They were headed to Venice so that he could compete in the Venice Marathon, and like us, where stopping at Florence on the way. It was a fairly interesting conversation, one point worth mentioning was a castle he told us about that is being built in France. Also on the train, was a bishop from Australia, who had been in Rome to see the canonization of Mary MacKillop. I think the fact that we were Australian's in Rome in that week made him assume we were on a Pilgrimage or something, because he asked if we knew some priest-guy from Rocky (who Rachael actually did). We were also stumped by questions he had about Australian news, which I have only vaguely been keeping up with and Rachael had been busy studying for exams. As such we left a very bad impression of our awareness of current affairs. The countryside we went past was also lovely, so all in all it was a pleasant journey and we were glad to be leaving Rome.\nWhen we arrived in Florence, we immediately agreed that the city was much nicer. The streets were cleaner, less crowded and there was just a generally better atmosphere. Our hostel was much nicer, and directly opposite the massive Cathedral in the centre of the city.\nWe walked around the city for a bit, and found ourselves at the massive Boboli Gardens. After Rachael eventually convinced me to part with 10 euro to get into the gardens we had a wonderful time exploring the absolutely massive grounds filled with random statues and trees that we had never seen before. There was some that looked like gum trees (but weren't obviously), and we even found olive trees and a tree that had dropped walnuts.\n\nFor DAY 2 we had a walking tour booked, which was okay but nothing special. In the morning there was an absolutely freezing wind and so a lot of the tour was spent trying to find a spot in the sun along the way. We saw everything we had seen the day before again, but learnt a little bit of history about them this time. After seeing the replica of the Statue of David for the 2nd time on the tour, we didn't see the need to pay to go inside and see the original when it finished, so we instead decided to pay to climb to the dome of the Duomo.\n\n\nThe painting on the inside of the Dome was amazing, and it was incredible how much detail went into a painting so high off the floor. The parts of the painting in heaven was pretty boring but the drawings of what happened to people in hell was intense and pretty funny.\n\nI think Rachael may have some sort of heart condition, because she was basically dead by the time we got to the top (to be fair it was 463 stairs), but once she had recovered we got to take in the magnificent view of the city. The railing/fence appeared to be a fairly new addition, so whoever built the cathedral was clearly crazy and had a death wish, as it is a long way up. Who knows how many people must have died to build it.\n\nLooking back, there wasn't anything particularly exciting in Florence, but it had a nice atmosphere and cool buildings and we found it to be much more enjoyable than Rome.\nThe next morning were back at the train station, waiting to head onwards to Venice.......\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-firenze/","title":"Firenze"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-luzern/":{"body":"\nOur trip to Luzern marked Rachael's first journey in a double-decker train, and we got to see some Swiss countryside on the way. I originally had planned for us to go the top of Mt. Pilatus, but when I checked the site in the morning it said the cable cars weren't running, so we gave up on that idea. Also for some reason my bank card wasn't working, so I couldn't get out anymore money so we had to make do with the amount of cash I already had on me.\nRachael was blown away by the snow-capped mountains that surround the city, and I must say they were quiet awesome. Having been in Switzerland for 4 months now, they have lost some of their first impact, but I can still very much appreciate the view. On the train, there was kids with placards saying \"Run Daddy, Run\" and it turns out that there was another marathon taking place!\nWe watched the marathon for a bit, as it's quite interesting just how diverse a range of people competed. There were old and young, couples and groups, even a blind guy and a guy in a roman outfit, complete with shield.\nI text Petr, who lives in Luzern and he came down to give us a tour of the city. The KapellbrÃ¼cke is the most famous part of the town. What is most interesting was that there was a fire a few years ago, and so now the artwork up top is now just black.\nMy highlight of the trip was the Lion Monument. This was a statue that was carved into the side of a cliff. Petr said it is the \"saddest statue in the world\" according to some actor that he had forgotten the name of. I think it was definitely the coolest statue I have seen so far, better by far then the ones in the Louvre.\n\nAfter this we went up to the old city wall, where you can climb the towers. Inside the tower you can see the workings of the clock, which involved a massive rock tied to a pendulum. We just so happened to be in the tower at 2:00 when the bell went off, ensuring that we will now go deaf one year earlier. Even more impressive was that daylight savings had just kicked in, and as there was no electric parts on the clock we couldn't work out how it knew how many times to ring. Somebody must have gone round to all the clocks that morning to put them all forward an hour.\nWe then made our way back to the lake to buy some food and drinks and take in the view. Rachael is a hater of beer so I thought I would get her to try some of the very different tasting varieties available in Europe, which taste wildly different to any beer I have had in Australia, and so I thought she might enjoy them. But be it wheat or tequila, Rachael likes neither. At least she gave it a go.\nThis basically brings us to the end of the trip. The next day I showed Rachael around Turgi, where I live and work and we walked to the nearby town of Baden, where she got to pat a sheep. Then she had to leave and I had to go back to work. It is a little sad, but at least I still have snow to look forward to... it's getting colder by the day.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-luzern/","title":"Luzern"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-milano/":{"body":"\nMy Euro Trip started in Turgi on Saturday morning... and it was raining and cold. Got a train to ZÃ¼rich where it was also raining, and waited for my train to Milan.\nOnce on the train things got better, and eventually we got away from the rain and up into the Alps. I was sitting next to a lady from Berlin and her daughter and they were pretty cool to talk to. The girl didn't speak very good English, and I don't speak very good German so we got to have some not very good conversations, but it was pretty fun.\nI got to see the second Swiss person give the finger in my travels. This guy on the train didn't have a ticket (I think that's what was happening - they were arguing in Italian) so the ticket lady had this argument with him, which really escalated and I'm pretty sure she told him she had called the police to get him at the next station. Then at the next station they both got off and she gave him the finger and he walked away. I think it was the first sort of argument/fight I have seen in Switzerland, although we were basically in Italy.\nAlso crazy was the noticeable difference from the Swiss side of the border to the Italian side. Basically on the Swiss side there was small, quaint, neat houses and then 3 mins later as we crossed the border there was derelict rundown Italian buildings covered in graffiti that appeared to have been neglected for the last 10 years or so. It was just so striking how close the two towns were but how different they looked.\nThe same can't be said for Milan. The train station in Milan was epic. It had massive ceilings with large stone columns, and was just generally an impressive building.\nOutside the train station was a different matter, and stepping outside you could see that Milan was a modern city. It was basically like the city centre of Brisbane, lots of skyrises and nothing particularly cool to see. After spending what was probably a good hour or so finding a map, I worked out which way the Duomo was and headed towards it. It wasn't that far to walk, but with luggage with me it was a very annoying walk. I hadn't done any research on Milan so didn't really know what I was looking for, but walked into the \"Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II\" which had a massive glass dome roof. Then out into the plaza which had the craziest looking church, the Duomo di Milano. Again, having luggage ruined the experience because I wasn't allowed inside the church with it. But it was still cool to see from the outside. Then I went for a further walk and found the \"Castello Sforzesco\" which was pretty cool, but again it was hard to explore and look around too much with a suitcase with me.\nAt this stage it looked like it was going to rain and would get dark soon, so I started heading back to the train station. At one point a police chase went past, maybe they were chasing the mafia... there was about 4 or 5 cop cars with sirens blaring. It started raining basically as I got there at about 6.30pm, and then later on started pouring. It then got really cold once it got dark and I had to put on my new ski jacket that I bought, but even then it was still freezing. So then I had to wait in the cold train station for 6 hours or so for my train to Rome and the train station seemed a lot less awesome then when I first got there.\nOne interesting thing happened at about 10. I'm not sure what exactly was going on, but I walked past this homeless guy on the ground that was going crazy on an umbrella, bending all the metal rods and snapping them. Everybody nearby then grabbed there umbrellas and left. So I'm not sure if it was his or someone else's. Was bizarre to watch, but I then left as well because this guy was clearly one angry homeless dude.\nOnce the train finally boarded, I was pretty impressed that we actually got a sort of bed. The seat rests had been folded back and a sheet put down so the 3 seats became a bed, and another bed was folded down up top. Then some creepy looking Mexican guy came in and I was reminded of the scene on the train in the movie Euro Trip and got a little concerned. But then I think he either was in the wrong compartment or didn't have a ticket because when the ticket inspector came around he left (they were talking in Spanish or Italian so I didn't know what exactly was going on). Then a young Swiss/Italian guy came in who was pretty cool and I had a chat to him. The actual trip itself was okay, not amazing because it's hard to sleep on a train when it bumps around and makes so much noise, but was certainly a good way to travel that saves on accommodation and time.\nI then basically slept until I got to Rome........\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-milano/","title":"Milano"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-paris/":{"body":"Coming in on the train in the morning we got to see some epic countryside. France was a lovely country and I want to go back again and see more of it one day.\nWhen we got off our train we needed to catch the Metro to our Hostel. The ticket system sucks. There was only one ticket machine and about 40 people lined up to use it. After we finally got our ticket we were on our way, and despite being very crowded it was pretty convenient and cheap.\nAs soon as we got there we knew that this Hostel was going to be awesome. And having stayed there I would say it was the best Hostel I have ever been to so far. Only problem is, it's a long way from anything interesting, which isn't a big deal if you use the Metro, but as we didn't really no what we were doing and had a bus tour (but didn't know the stops) we started walking to the Louvre and trying to find a bus stop on the way. There was several but they were really badly signed, and we didn't find them until later when we had a brochure with all the stops. So we ended up walking to the Louvre.\nIt was a lovely walk, but Rachael wasn't in a good mood (I think all the walking was starting to get to her) so I don't think she enjoyed it. She was much happier once we finally got the Louvre. Well that's not true, I said that we were at the Louvre as soon as I saw it but she wouldn't beleive me until we walked all the way around to the front entrance which has the glass pyramid. Having talked to someone the next day, this is the worst entrance to go to because it means you have to line up for an hour or so instead of 5mins at a side entrance.\n\n\nSo having waited in line, we got to go inside. The sheer enormity of the place is incredible. It is huge. I had been told by many people that you need several days to see it all, but we saw most things in 4 hours. And after 4 hours we had well and truly had enough and wanted to leave. Every room had something cool in it, but the place is so huge and there is so much to see I don't think many people could handle longer than that without becoming exhausted.\n\nSo we left, and found our Hop-on Hop-off bus. We spent the rest of the day sitting on it as it slowly took us home. The wind up top was freezing so we had to go downstairs, which was shame because there was so many cool sights. We went up to the top again sometimes for the particularly interesting sections, like the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es and Eiffel Tower, but the cold was pretty offputting.\nThe roundabout around the Arc de Triomphe was really crazy, you can understand why it's not possible to get insurance there, it seemed like madness but there wasn't any accidents so there must be a fairly good system in place. I am pretty sure that unlike a normal roundabout, people coming onto the roundabout have right-of-way rather than people on the roundabout because we were constantly stopping to let people on.\nIn Rome it had been great because everything was so close together, but the bus tour of Paris took forevor. By the time we finally got to stop near our Hostel we were freezing and starving. At the stop was a subway so we went in there. They have 15cm and 30cm subs. We were cut. How come Australia has to use the term \"footlong\" if they don't. It was also interesting to see how different the food was even though it was the same meals. The chicken fillet looked nothing like our one, and it had vegies and stuff cooked into it as well.\nBack at the hostel we had a second dinner in the form of some Fish and Chips, and a few drinks before heading upstairs to get some sleep.\nOn DAY 2 we waited at our hostel which was the starting point of the free walking tour. Like the Munich one, the tour was great and we learnt a lot about the city. On the river Seine we got to see some police going scuba diving looking for bodies. Our guide informed us that they were probably checking for suiciders as the bridge is a popular place for that sort of thing. We also got to see a space invader mosiac. I had seen a couple in Bern as well, but apperently Paris was the first place where they started appearing, because the guy that does it is French. His most famous one is on the Hollywood sign in America.\n\nWe crossed the Pont Neuf (New Bridge) which is the oldest bridge in Paris - it was new at the time of naming obviously. We were shown a spot from the Bourne Identity, and a place which is haunted. We also crossed another bridge later on that had more of the padlocks on it. It's kind of funny that the government comes through twice a year with bolt cutters to remove them all - kind of defeats the point for people doing it.\nAfter we had been to the Louvre and some other places that I have probably forgotten, Jenny (our guide) led us to this random place too see some modern art. It was probably the first modern art I have seen that I actually found cool. We were told that the artist beleives that art should be something that you don't have to pay for, you find unexpectedly and makes you have an oppinion about it (good or bad).... and it was definitetly that. It was called Les Deux Plateaux, and stripey art dude I salute you for making it, I enjoyed it.\n\nThen we went through the Tuileries Gardens, and walked down towards the obelisk and then across the river again to a war museum where the body of Napoleon is kept. Then after the tour some of us went to a french cafe and had some Croquemonsieur and wine.\nAfter our french cafe experience, Rachael and I left and went to see the Eiffel Tower up close, which was kind of cool except for all the guys with machine guns and the hundreds of dodgy guys selling mintature towers. Interestinly we found out there is a single bedroom apartment at the top of the eiffel tower that the designer had installed for himself that he could take \"friends\" to. It would be a pretty impressive pick-up line for sure.\n\n\n\nAfter that we rode around on the bus a bit, went inside the Cathedral Notre Dame de Paris and watched some street dancers outside.\n\n\nWe then got the bus to the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es in order to climb to the top of the Arc de Triomph. There was more street dancers there as well.\n{{&lt; vimeo 16563098 &gt;}}\nThe view from the top at night was spectacular and I reccomend it to everyone. I'm sure it is great in the day but at night the lights of the city were spectacular.\n\n\n\n\nThis time we got the metro home instead of the bus, which made the journey much quicker. That is once we worked out where to go, we got a little bit confused. The place is like a giant maze and most of the time we had no idea where we were or how far underground.\nOn DAY 3 we weren't quite ready to leave Paris, it was a great city. Nonetheless, we had to check out and get a train to the airport. The whole day was basically wasted, because not only do you have to spend hours waiting at the airport, our plane sat on the tarmac for about another hour before we actually took off, I have no idea why. But eventually we were off and on our way to Prague....\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-paris/","title":"Paris"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-praha/":{"body":"Due to our delayed flight from France, we got into Prague later than we were supposed to. By the time we found our Hostel we had 30 mins to get to the walking tour we had booked. We asked at reception how long it would take to get there and got told about 30 mins. So we made a mad rush, but got the tram in the wrong direction, got a bit lost and went to a Mexican restaurant instead.\nI got some traditional Czech cuisine in the form of roasted duck with red cabbage and dumplings. Rachael got a shot of tequila. Actually she got a meal as well, but as alcohol is cheap as in Prague, she was very excited about the drinks.\nOne thing that has confused me a lot here is the whole tipping procedure. Our bill had a place where you wrote how much you wanted to tip, but we weren't sure what you are supposed to give so we gave 10%. In Venice they didn't even ask, we just got charged 15% on top of the total added at the bottom of the bill (which seemed a bit dodgy). I much prefer it in Australia where you don't have to worry about these things.\nAt the hostel we had 2 free beers as a welcome gift at the hostel bar, so we went to enjoy those (well I did) and Rachael tried some more shots. The bar guys were getting right into it, dancing like mad and cranking the music. It was a bit out-of-place considering there was only 3 people in the bar besides Rachael and I, and they were all on the computers using Facebook.\nOn DAY 2 we swapped over to our 5 star Hotel. It was very fancy, and we even had a porter take our luggage upstairs for us, but I have a feeling that a 5 star Hotel in Australia would have been a bit better. We weren't complaining though, after some of the places we had stayed at in Italy we were living in luxury - although it's a bit of a waste of money because we didn't spend much time at the Hotel with so much to see in only 2 days.\nExploring the old town, we were lucky enough to arrive during a food festival with food markets everywhere with all kinds of different foods we hadn't seen before. Everything was cooked on an open fire in front of you and it had an amazing atmosphere to it, I'm hoping that is what the Christmas markets will be like here in December.\n\nAfter exploring the city a bit by ourselves, we went on the free walking tour for Prague. Like the previous tours, the tour was excellent and we got to hear lots of interesting stories about the city. We got to visit the Louvre again, or at least the building that was supposed to be the Louvre in the movie \"Euro Trip\". Lots of movies are apparently filmed in Prague because everything is so cheap there. There was lots of other cool stories and places to see, and the history of Czech Republic itself was quite interesting as well.\n\n\nAfter the tour we had some dinner, this time I got a porkknuckle, but it wasn't as epic as the one I had in Munich. The dumpling was a bread one as well, so not as cool as the potato one I had at Augustiner. I had a beer which was called a semi-dark beer. Petr told me later that it's actually a dark beer and a light beer mixed together. Rachael got some Goulash, which was also nice.\nHaving missed our paid tour the night before, Rachael rang up and we were able to go on a different tour the next night. Worst. Tour. Ever. We met the lady at Charles Bridge for the tour, and it was just us and a Japanese couple. She told us we would quickly meet her friend at the other side of the bridge, which turned out to be her date, who we suspect was a bit drunk. The actual tour itself was quite nice I suppose, we got a train up to the top of the hill and then walked through a nice park down towards Prague castle. It was a nice area and a nice walk. As far as the tour was concerned though, we didn't learn too much. The information we did gain came about through questions we asked her, but besides answering our questions she wasn't very forthcoming with information.\nOn DAY 3 we got to experience a 5 star breakfast, and it was indeed the best breakfast of the trip. It was basically on par with the breakfast I got at Hamilton Island one time, but after the breakfasts we'd had at previous places it was truly unbelievable. I don't think I've ever had banana cake for breakfast before. After breakfast, we walked up the hill to visit Prague Castle.\nPrague Castle - it looks epic from down at the city looking up at it. So imagine how cool it actually must be to walk up and go inside - it was .... meh. The church was cool but after being to the Vatican it was rather dull. There was an art gallery which was cool, but after being to the Louvre it was also not that special. The actual castle only had about 3 rooms you could visit and while they were nice, failed to impress us. I think maybe if it had been the first stop on our journey we would have been far more appreciative, but we left a little disappointed at how little there was to see for a ticket that I'm pretty sure cost twice that of the Louvre.\n\nWe walked back down to the city to pick up our luggage, and then found our way to the train station, where we waited for our bus to NÃ¼rnberg. The bus ride out of Prague was beautiful, the countryside of Czech Republic was just spectacular. I think it was mostly because of all the autumn leaves adorning the trees, but I am sure it looks pretty good during the rest of the year as well.\nWe listened to some Tim Minchin on the bus as we drove along the Autobahn, then got to the town of NÃ¼rnberg. If we didn't have luggage and it wasn't dark I would have loved to explored, but instead we spent the time waiting for the next train playing Eye-Spy. From here we got an ICE train to Munich. The ICE trains are crazy fast, 269km/hr it said it was going on the LED display. And yet it was the quietest and smoothest train we have been on. Pretty impressive.\nEventually we arrived in Munich, and made our way to the JÃ¤ger Hostel. At the JÃ¤ger Hostel you get a free shot of JÃ¤ger, but as it was midnight and we were exhausted, we just went straight to sleep as we had to be up early the next day.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-praha/","title":"Praha"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-roma/":{"body":"\nSo after waking up and waiting for the train to arrive, we stopped at Roma Tiburtina Station. It was not what I was expecting at all for the capital city of Italy.\nThe train station had several homeless inhabitants, and smelt a bit funky. My plan had been to walk to Roma Termini Station to meet Rachael about an hour later, but there was no signage as to what direction anything was. After looking around aimlessly the sun finally came up a bit higher, and now knowing which direction was North, I started to head in the general direction of Rachael's train station.\nOnce away from the train station a bit, I got a better idea of where I was (had a map on my iPod) and managed to find my way to the station with plenty of time to meet Rachael. Once we were reunited, I next task was to find our Hostel. Neither Rachael or I had brought directions, so we were forced to go off my very vague memory that it was only 2 streets from the station, although which streets I couldn't remember. After walking through several streets with luggage in tow, we FINALLY found our Hostel and were able to dump our gear. By the time we had carried our luggage up the two flights of stairs to reception, Rachael had almost had a heart attack and died. We used the lift from then on.\nWith our luggage no longer in the way, we set out to explore the city. Around each new corner we would find something interesting and old-looking to discover and after walking past a couple of ruins we made our way towards the Colosseum and the forum. After a quick look, we decided to come back another day and continued exploring the city on foot, heading towards a field that we later found out was the place where chariot races were held, were there was a festival taking place in which people were re-enacting something and in old-time Roman gear.\nWe stumbled into some amazing church that was basically all gold (maybe not but it blinded you with extravagance). I wish I could have filmed Rachael's face as her jaw just dropped and stayed dropped for about 5mins. Then we got an elevator up to the top of the \"Giant White Monstrosity\" which was next door.\n\nMore walking around the city, we found somewhere to have lunch. 2 shitty overpriced pizzas later and we continued on our journey, this time walking to the Trevi Fountain, which was a pretty rad fountain that I had never heard of, much to Rachael's dismay. Apparently it's in \"a million different movies\" but I imagine they are mostly all chick-flicks. The area itself was packed with other tourists, and so we left as soon as possible.\nWe found near the train station an area where artists were selling paintings, most of which were incredible and we got to see some art for free that was better than most of the stuff we saw in museums.\nWe then went back to our semi-dodgy hostel for some sleep. The room itself was nice, just the fact that the the shower and toilet was in the same cubicle and there idea of \"breakfast included\" means providing bread and jam every day was dodgy.\nDAY 2 in Rome, we went on a \"Hop-on Hop-off Tour\" which is a open top bus that drives you around the city. We also took a boat up the river as part of the deal, but it was a pretty boring river really. After getting a glimpse of the front of the Vatican, which still had posters and stuff up from the canonization the day before, we headed back on the bus to visit the Colosseum.\n\nAt the Colosseum, some lady offered us a skip-the-line tour which we paid for and went on. Our guide was really good and told us all kinds of facts about the games, and related it back to modern times. The actual Colosseum itself is much smaller than I expected, but was still a pretty cool building and must have been incredible back when it was built.\nAs part of our tour we also got to see the forum, this time with a different guide, who was also good. We learnt that after the Roman Empire fell, the city dropped back to a tiny population and most of the ancient city was used as a dump and buried. When Napoleon came along a few hundred years ago, he saw the top of an arc of triumph that had a door cut into it and a guy doing haircuts inside. He thought that it was disgusting that the former greatest city in the world had been turned into a dump, and after that they started digging up the city, and what we saw was only 2% of the original city. Most of it is still underground but because they have built on top of it they aren't allowed to boot people out of their homes on the off chance there is some epic statue underneath it. There was also a church with a floating door that you couldn't enter, because they built the church on top of an older building and when they dug everything back to the original height and uncovered the building below the door of the church is way higher.\n\nAt the end the guide told us about a night tour that he was doing, but when we went to the meeting point later he never showed up. So then we just went home. On the way we had another go and trying to get some authentic Italian cuisine and found a nicer looking restaurant where we got some Angry Spaghetti and Quattro Fromage Pizza. Unlike the day before, these tasted pretty amazing.\n\nWe also got the bus past some sort of movie premier for an Italian movie that we had seen lots of posters for, but we didn't know any of the actors so we didn't really care.\nDAY 3 saw us leaving Italy for the morning and entering the Vatican City, which I didn't realise is actually a country to itself. The Vatican museum was simply incredible, and the reason is that everything cool in Rome was stolen by the church and is in that museum. St Peter's Basilica is basically ancient Rome because they stole all the expensive marble and gold etc. from the Colosseum and pantheon and what not to build it, which is why the city is now ruins and the forum was turned into a dump. There was rooms and rooms of statues and tapestries and everything you could think of, and every room had incredible artworks on the walls and ceilings, with intricate tile mosaics on the floor.\nA special type of purple marble was used for a tonne of Statues, and our guide told us that the Vatican owns something like 90% of of this marble in existence. By far my favourite part of the museum was the Raphael Rooms and in particular, this painting.\n\nBy DAY 4 we were ready to leave Rome behind, and so after checking out of the Hostel we basically just waited at the train station for 2 hours for our train to Florence...\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-roma/","title":"Roma"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-schloss-neuschwanstein/":{"body":"After a few quick hours of sleep in Munich, we were checking out again. At the train station we waited for the tour to start, and then after seeing a sign for the Neuschwanstein Tour, signed up. Turns out it was the wrong one, and not the Sandeman's one that we had to planned to go on. Our guide was perfectly good though, and in fact probably needed the money more as the other group was much bigger and there was only 2 other people with us.\nWe went to get our train to FÃ¼ssen only to find that the train had been cancelled, so instead we had to get a bus. So we got a bus, changed to a train, changed to another train then another train, then another bus until finally we were there only one hour later than planned. The view on the way was great, lots of green countryside and forests with random patches of snow the closer we got.\n\nAfter the woman at the tourist office was nice enough to let us leave our luggage, we journeyed onward to look up at Hohenschwangau Castle, which was the original royal castle / holiday house.\n\nAfter Rachael got to play in the snow a bit, and throw some snowballs (strangely she didn't throw any at me, was totally expecting it and would have been fine with it - you missed your chance!) we got a bus up to Marys Bridge. From here we got to see the waterfall and the castle.\n\n\n\n\nThe castle was epic in every sense of the word. Ludwig was clearly a crazy maniac, he had a room dedicated to the swan and there was a room that was a man-made cave. It actually felt like you were in a cave and the doors had rocks on the back so you really wouldn't know otherwise. What a nutter. Wikipedia has a good article on the Neuschwanstein Castle.\nBecause we were an hour late coming in, we didn't get to go down to the lake which was a shame but better than missing our train home. Apparently one of the lakes was the lake that the opera \"Swan Lake\" is named after.\n\nOn the train back to Buchloe heard the various story's of Ludwig's death, because he died under \"Mysterious Circumstances\". We asked our guide what they do in Buchloe and he said \"make supercars\". Apparently he was hitch-hiking from Berlin and the CEO of the company picked him up in one of the cars and offered to take him to Munich. He said it's normally like an 8 hours journey, but they did it in 3. No speed limit on the autobahn means they were travelling 300km/h or so for most of the journey.\nOur train home was okay, we got to talk to a girl from America that was a screenwriter and was writing a movie. We had a pretty interesting conversation to say the least, and she had a very different personality to anyone I've met before.\nAlso on the way into Switzerland, two guys from customs came through with a sniffer dog and spent ages going through this lady's bag. He then checked our passports and such and I think Rachael was a little freaked out because she didn't know what was going (they were mostly speaking in German and were in street clothes). We changed trains at Winterthur and met some Aussie students, one of them was doing engineering. The train also started to fill with people coming and going from the clubs in ZÃ¼rich, as it was a Saturday night which always makes for an interesting train ride. At long last we made it home (or to Switzerland in Rachael's case) and got some sleep before yet more travel the next day. Oh and because I didn't have any food at home except Chocolate, and the shops are closed at that time, we got to have that for tea. Rachael very much approved of the chocolate, but I think not so much about having it as a meal.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-schloss-neuschwanstein/","title":"Schloss Neuschwanstein"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-summary-and-tips/":{"body":"This final Euro Trip post (before we get back to Switzerland) is to sum up my impressions of each city. In particular it is dedicated to Tim and Kate who might be coming over next year, or anyone else that plans on travelling to Europe in the future. Hopefully these tips/comments will be able to make your trip even more enjoyable than ours.\nPlaces\nRome - Rome as a place to visit is a must. There is so much history and places to see that it's somewhere everywhere should go once. Having been once, I don't think I will go back but a one time visit is essential. The two highlights were the Colosseum/Forum Tour and the Vatican Museum.\nWe found Rome to be a fairly dirty/unfriendly/busy city. People I talked to (both before going and after) were divided: 50% agreed that it was a yucky city, while 50% thought it was superb. So this indicates to me that it all depends on what areas you visit, as I had a bad first impression, but found the touristy areas nice. Make sure you find some good accommodation even if it's a bit more expensive. The hostel we stayed at \"Hostel Roma Downtown\" wasn't very good, but we heard that the other ones are even worse so make sure you read some reviews before staying anywhere.\nFlorence - Florence was a magnificent city, and the hostel we stayed at \"Academy Hostel\" was great, we even got some free pasta for dinner. Make sure you visit the gardens and the duomo, and maybe some museums if you are into that sort of thing. There wasn't a great deal of things to see and do, so you probably don't want more than 2 days.\nVenice - For some reason the reception at our hotel \"Residence Al Carmini\" was only open from 9 - 2 each day, and when we were there at 9 one morning there was nobody there, so I don't think even that is truthful. It made leaving luggage and checking out a big hassle, so make sure you check when reception is open in advance for any of the places that you stay at.\nParis - Paris was Rachael and I's favourite city and two days was not enough. I think you would need about a week to see it properly. The hostel we stayed at \"St. Christopher's Hostel\" was excellent and I highly recommend it. You probably don't need to plan anything in advance, just see what takes your fancy each day. In particular we got told that there are always concerts and shows going on, and if there are still seats left an hour before the show then they sell them for only $10 each.\nPrague- Prague was a lovely city, and the food and drinks were so cheap. If you have time, maybe leave the city and go to somewhere nearby as it will get cheaper still and I'm sure is just as nice. The \"Plus Hostel Prague\" was pretty good, as was the 5 star place we stayed at \"Hotel Pariz\".\nNeuschwanstein Castle - This castle screams \"massive waste of money\" in every single way, but it has turned out pretty well in the long-term, as once the king died they opened it up to tourists and now make 0.25mil euro a day. Well worth a visit at least once just to see how stupidly extravagant it is. The view from the castle is great as well, with lots of lakes and the Austrian alps surrounding it.\nTours\nThe best tours in Europe are by far the NewEurope tours. In fact I reckon that you could probably book a holiday of Europe just around these tours and it would be epic, I will probably do this if I come back, try to go on each one. They also have paid tours and pub crawls as well, which we didn't have time for.\nThe Hop-on Hop-off bus tour in Rome was great because everything was so close and it made travel convenient, but not as convenient in Paris because everything was so far apart. The Paris metro was cheap and easy so I would probably suggest this as a better option to travel. The actual \"tour\" part (in the form of the audio guides) was pretty dull for both though.\nSkip-the-line tours are great, the Vatican would have sucked without it because the line was huge and by paying for the tour you get in straight away. The tour itself was pretty good, nothing exceptional but definitely better than navigating the place by yourself. The Colosseum skip-the-line tour was also great. We found it by accident as they were selling tickets out the front, but I recommend paying the extra 10 euro or so over lining up, and you get a guide!\nMost of the paid walking tours that we did were horrible and I would recommend against them. The one in Venice was an exception because of the Gondola tour, but the tour itself wasn't too bad either.\nLanguage\nTry to learn some basic words in the language, especially for Paris. I've always heard about how rude people are there, but as long as you open with \"Bonjour, Parlez vous Anglais?\" the seemed to be nice enough. That goes for all the places, you don't need to speak the language, but at least learn Hello and Thankyou. This was pretty easy for everywhere but Prague, because they have some russian looking letters and we had no idea how to pronounce it. But we asked someone and \"Ahoy\" is the informal way to say both hello and goodbye, so just pretend that you are a pirate and they might understand you. Most people speak at least some basic English in Europe so we had no problems.\nOther\nBring your student ID card. Rachael didn't for some reason so she had to pay full price at some places. They might not recognise Oz ID's everywhere, but so far I haven't had any problems.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-summary-and-tips/","title":"Europe - Summary and Tips"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-venezia/":{"body":"\nComing into Venice was pretty exciting, especially when the train finally got past the mainland and we were on a bridge, heading out to sea and the island of Venice. My first impression wasn't that great to be honest, I expected it to be cooler. The view from the train station wasn't particularly dazzling and it wasn't until a bit later that we got to see places that were more like my expectations.\nGetting around Venice sucks. It is in fact, not actually an island, but rather lots of little islands joined together by bridges. So while our Hotel wasn't that far from the train station, it was still an effort to get there. When we finally get to the Hotel we find it closed, with a sign out the front saying that reception is only open until 2pm. It's only 2.10 so we ring the doorbell a few times and eventually someone comes out, lets us in and gives us a key. The hotel itself was great (especially the view out the window of a canal), but the service was ... non-existent.\nAfter dumping our luggage, the stairs weren't so frustrating and we got to explore the city. Unfortunately, there isn't much too it. It's just shops, shops and more shops. Oh and some B&amp;B's and Restaurants. Regardless, it's such a different experience to be somewhere with canals instead of streets so we were content with walking around aimlessly and looking at abandoned buildings that had water lapping against the front doors.\n\n\nWe set out to find a supermarket, but after a lot of looking, we still couldn't find one. We headed back to the train station in the hope there would be one there, and found a shop inside that had some very pricey pasta and pasta sauce, that would need to do. It was Italian pasta at least. We also bought a bottle of \"Grappa\" (looked like red wine but with some grapes still in the bottle of the bottle) that was 12 euro and 40% alcohol and came in an awesome looking bottle to go with our meal. We asked the cashier what it tasted like, but she was no help as didn't speak English. Another lady told us it tasted nothing like red wine but that it was good.\n\nAfter cooking up our epic dinner, we discovered that trying the local cuisine isn't always a good thing. The pasta was okay, nothing special, but the Grappa was absolutely disgusting. I managed to finish my glass for the sake of not wasting it, but Rachael couldn't handle more than one sip. Even watering it down didn't help. We talked to some people about it later, and it turns out that while a lot of Italians do drink it straight, most sane people only use it in cooking. Thanks lady at the shop that said it was nice. Rachael wanted to pour it all down the sink, but we ended it up leaving it in the room and told reception they could have it when we checked out.\nOn DAY 2 we set out to find St. Marco Square, as we had a walking tour there in the afternoon and had no idea where it was. The city is like a maze, and eventually we found it after heading who knows where on the island. Luckily there was lots of cool things to see on the way, such as areas of the island that were flooded because it was high-tide. The actual square itself was flooded too when we found it, and it appeared like the church would be too, but when we went back that afternoon we saw that it was designed a bit better so the entrance was higher than the water level and acted as a barrier to stop it coming in.\n\n\nWe stumbled across a supermarket at last, and got some MUCH cheaper pasta and some wine that was in English and we knew we would like. Rachael was over the trying Italian wine phase until I showed her the prices, at which point she quickly changed her mind. It took ages to get home as the city really is a maze, and there is no such things as shortcuts because most streets come to dead-ends if there isn't a bridge to let you cross at the end, making our attempt at shortcuts into massive detours.\nOur attempt at home-cooked Italian cuisine was much better this time, and the pasta was delicious. More walking BACK to the square afterwards for our walking tour made us pretty excited for the opportunity to sit and a Gondola and do nothing. The walking tour was fairly interesting, but there wasn't a whole lot to see besides a cool looking spiral staircase building. We learnt a few things about the island though, most important being that basically nobody lives there anymore, it's just full of tourists. All the locals moved out to neighboring islands and just come in for work.\n\nThe gondola ride at the end of our tour was great, it started off boring as we went along for a bit in the sea first, but once we were going through all the little canals it was really cool. We then had to walk back to our hotel yet again, and I think Rachael worked it out later that we did about 16km of walking that day.\n\n{{&lt; vimeo 16560337 &gt;}}\nOn DAY 3 we had to walk to the Square yet again to go on a Boat trip to 3 of the surrounding islands. While we were waiting they were setting up for the Venice marathon.\nThe first island we went to was Murano, where we got to see how glass was made. It was incredible to watch and I had no idea how much skill would be needed to do it. Check out the video of the guy making a horse sculpture.\n{{&lt; vimeo 16560205 &gt;}}\nNext stop was to Burano, which is famous for lace making. Unlike glass making, lace is really boring. The island itself was still pretty cool though as all the houses were painted different bright colours. We saw a church tower that was leaning, and discovered that in the absence of having cars, the young hooligans put the fully sick sub-woofers in their boats. It was strange situation in which we heard the doof doof of a Kate Perry song as some young guy drove past in his tinny.\n\nThe third island was Torcello, which we had been warned by our walking tour guide the day before was a boring, ugly island... and indeed it was.\nWhen we came back the marathon was on, but we didn't have time to watch as we had to race back the hotel and grab our luggage. Luckily we got back just on 2, and were able to grab our stuff. I still think that it's crazy that there would only be someone there until 2 in the afternoon.\nWe took our luggage to the train station and paid to have them stored there so we didn't have to carry them around, and set out to find some food. We saw a sign for McDonalds and thought it would be a good place to spend a while without getting kicked out but spent ages looking and never found it. It then started to rain so we went to another restaurant, had some lunch then went back to the train station. It continued to rain and be freezing as we waited a few hours for our train. Our train was meant to leave at 7 but we stayed in the station for a good hour or so due to \"technical difficulties\" before finally leaving Italy behind and heading onward to Paris.....\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-venezia/","title":"Venezia"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/food-beer/":{"body":"Was kind of like a custard slice, but cheese.

While I know most of the bands, I have never heard of a lot of the songs people are voting for. Rachael has impressed me this year by voting and has picked some good songs that I had not heard of before. Before we started going out she didn't even listen to triple J and now she is more up with the music then me.\nUsually I find it extremely hard to narrow my list down to only 10 votes, but this year I found the opposite. It was hard for me to pick 10 stand-out songs from the year. I have been away for half the year, so I thought it would be fitting if I narrow it down to my top 5 instead. I am sure there are plenty of great songs that better deserved my vote, and I am looking forward to hearing them all in January and catching up with the last half-year of music.\nOK Go - End Love\nGreatest music video of the year, second only to the This Too Shall Pass video. Even without the video accompanying it, the song is incredibly catchy and makes me happy when I hear it.\nMurray Gold &amp; the BBC National Orchestra of Wales - I am the Doctor\nI don't even know who Freya Elizabeth from Kyu is, but she listed this as her favourite song of 2010 in the celebrity list. While I wouldn't have even considered it if I hadn't have seen her list, it's a crazy suspense-building song that reminds me of the show - so it gets a place.\nPendulum - ABC Theme (Remix)\nI always love hearing the JJJ news theme. I was at a party in ZÃ¼rich and Asako (from Australia) had JJJ streaming in the background. I wasn't paying much attention but then they played the news theme - something I could recognis anywhere - and it was a nice reminder of home. I don't mind the ABC news theme either, but I never would I have thought that someone could make a song out of it. A bloody cool one at that.\nThe Cat Empire - Call Me Home\nI don't think I have ever disliked a Cat Empire album. Each release is less impressive to me than the last, but I still enjoy every song to some extent. I have wanted to see the Cat Empire live for years, and I finally saw them in Munich in October, incredibly hungover after a big day at Oktoberfest. This was their final song..... and it was incredible.\nThe Temper Trap - Resurrection (Penguin Prison Remix)\nLeading up to and well after the Big Day Out, my most played album was by far Conditions by The Temper Trap. They were absolutely amazing live and I am in love with every song on the album. I voted for them last year, but I am voting again this year for remixed version of Resurrection. The whole album has been remixed but this is the only one I have really listened to. I wouldn't go as far as to say it's better than the original, but it gives it a new feel and had me listening to it all over again. So this Remix gets my final vote.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/hottest-100-votes-2010/","title":"Hottest 100 Votes 2010"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/hottest-100-votes-of-the-past/":{"body":"\nAs it comes once again to Hottest 100 voting time, this year I think I am unqualified to vote. Having been overseas for 6 months, I have not been keeping up with the music released in Australia and popular post-June. On the other hand I am happy that the list this year will provide me with lots of new music to listen to. But before I start to look at what I am going to vote for, I wanted to look back on what I voted for in the past. The first time I voted was in 2003, and my pick for number 1 was \"I Love Work\" although I was happy enough with Seven Nation Army and Hey Ya taking out the top 2 spots. In that year I didn't even use up the full 10 votes you are allowed, I think I only used 7. In years after that I took it much more seriously and always used my ten votes carefully.\nSo I am going to try and find copies of my lists from past years, although this could prove an impossible task. I posted my votes somewhere each year, but 6 years ago was before Facebook and the posts from my Myspace account are long since deleted.

ALMOST voted for Nowhere Without You instead, another great song.\nChanging Emily - Special Patrol\nI really have no idea why I like this song. I just do.\nDistance - Ellington\nThis vote is kinda a waste, cause they have no chance of getting in the list. But I love this song. It's Rohan's cousins band (he told me to download). There other EP songs are good too, but not as good as distance.\nStarlight - Muse\nBlack Fingernails, Red Wine - Eskimo Joe\nHmm, not there best album. But the chorus still makes this a good catchy song.\nHere It Goes Again - OK Go\nPerhaps not the greatest song in the world, but the video clip more than compensates for any doubt in whether it should get a vote.\nWhen You Were Young - The Killers\nDespite the fact that it was on Sarah's So Fresh CD, this is still a good song.\n\nHonourable Mentions.......\n\nOne Crowded Hour - Augie March\nGet Up Outta The Dirt - Butterfingers\nWasting My Time - The Dirty Secrets\nTonight!

It really was quite steep in places, made the bus ride up to the Remarkables in New Zealand tame in comparison. Because it was only one lane the bus driver was constantly hitting the horn to let cars know we were coming round the corner. The swiss post buses have a REALLY loud and long horn tune.\nAnd then began the hiking. The first stage was about on par with the Jura weekend hike. Quite steep and energy draining but a pleasant stroll in comparison to what came later.\n\nAfter about an hour hike we made it to a restaurant and alpine cheese factory. We got to see how they made the cheese, and how it is aged. To be able to market as Alpine cheese, the cows have to live and the cheese has to be made at a certain altitude (I forget what). In the winter they move everything down into the valley though.\n\nWe got to try some. It tasted like cheese.\nThen the hiking continued, this was the hardest part of the weekend. It was incredibly steep and in many places slippery. Incredible views though. Eventually we all made it to the top - well as high as you could go without climbing gear - to the cottage that we were staying at. The only was to get supplies there is by helicopter (or by carting it up the massive hike). We had some beers when we got there and it reminded me so much of beers in Lake Tekapo on the NZ Ski Trip last year. For Comparison (NZ | Schwiez) Then we went down for a bit of a walk on the glacier, which was\nfun although quickly turned into everyone throwing chunks of ice at each other. There was an Aussie guy from Adelaide on the glacier that took a group photo for us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe stayed the night in the BlÃ¼emlisalphÃ¼tte alpine cottage. Our room had a top and bottom bunk, but they are all joined so it's about 20 mattresses up the top and 20 down the bottom so you all sleep close together. As such we got to hear some nice snoring through the night. It wasn't too bad though. Also you weren't allowed hiking boots inside so you had to\nwear sandals. The Swiss sure love socks and sandals. I should mention that even at work you see people wearing socks and sandals. Dinner was really nice, they do pretty well for somewhere so remote. Even the beer wasn't too expensive (6.50CHF for 5dl). That's another thing that is stange here. They don't use mL. They use cL and dL. I have no idea\nwhy, it seems to be a Europe thing but it doesn't make much sense.\n\n\n\nSunset was particularly amazing, the view of the various peaks of the alps was spectacular. Once it got dark, it got really cold. But I still ventured outside with a few other keen people and we did a bit of stargazing. There was no light pollution or clouds, so you could see everything perfect. It was also interesting to see all the different constellations of the northern hemisphere.\n\nThe next day we started the long hike down the other side to Oeschinen Lake and Kandersteg. Along the way Andreas found some Edelweiss, which is apparently a really rare flower. Also on a creek there was a salamander, which was quite cool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter having lunch by the lake we went tobogganing! YAY! It was quite lame I thought, was way too slow and much less fun than I was expecting.\nMore hiking down to Kandersteg, by this stage the trail was mostly meadows, so I could finally take of the Swiss Army boots I had been wearing all weekend and get some relief from the many, many blisters that had formed. Although the boots were quite heavy to carry and I had to pay close attention to where I was walking so I didn't stand in\nsheep poo.\nThose of us under 25 paid for a train to Bern and then walked around for a bit while we waited for the Gleis7 to kick in. Was a great weekend, but even today (2 days later) every step is difficult and walking up stairs is horrible.\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/iaeste-hiking-weekend/","title":"IAESTE Hiking Weekend"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/iaeste-jura-weekend/":{"body":"\nI have been very busy lately with assignments, German lessons and traveling, so haven't had time to update this in a while. On the weekend before last, I went to the Jura region, which is in the French-speaking part of Switzerland.\nFirst up, we went to the underground mills in Le Locle. They were used in the 1800s to make flour, and used the water that flowed through the cave to turn the mill. But for some strange reason Le Locle was built in the way of the river and it would often flood during the spring when the snow melted. So they bought out the mill and closed it down\nbecause they then redirected the river away from the town and it dried it up. The mill was then used as an abattoir and the owners dumped all of the animal waste down into the caves (don't know how that was allowed...). Then about 30 years ago (I think) some crazy historians decided they would take all the dumped waste out and make a museum. I have already forgotten most of the facts the tour guide told us, as it was 2 weeks ago now. There is more info here -\nhttp://www.lesmoulins.ch/ - but it's in french. It was a fairly interesting tour though.\n\nAfter that, we jumped on a train to ?somewhere? and visited an Absinthe factory. Well on the itinerary it said it was a factory, but it was more like some guy that made lots of it in his basement and sells it. The house alone was pretty cool. It used to be a drug store, and upstairs all the old chemicals and stuff were still there in this really cool, old cabinet. We found things like Cyanide and Chloroform, but the bottles of those two were empty.\n\nThen downstairs there was boxes with the herbs he uses to make the Absinth. There was 10 herbs, and one secret one that we weren't allowed to see. I didn't realise there was an actual absinthe plant, but there is. Also there was a one plant that you could easily smell straight away that it is what they use to make liquorice.\nThe guy had been making it for 30 years or something, but it has only been legal for the last 5. Apparently the region was renown for it's underground Absinth brewers, and there are still lots of them around (I guess to avoid tax).\nThe actual brewing itself was done in this steamer thing (I think with basically pure ethanol), and the end product is 75% alcohol. It is then diluted down to 55%, and the name of the product is Absinthe 55degrees.\n\nWe then had an apÃ¨ro and got to try some. It was not what I was expecting having had it only as shots. They mix it with water, and it goes all cloudy. It then tastes a bit like liquorice and doesn't burn as much. It is still very strong, but actually tasted like a drink rather than a shot.\n\n\nOh and we were told that the green fairy is a myth. The only difference is food colouring. The stories of hallucinations came about because the company that made the green fairy had a bad batch of really bad quality that was causing people to go a bit crazy. But not in a good way.\nFrom here we went to the hostel by the lake, and had a bit of a BBQ before dinner. The dinner wasn't all that great and the waitress seemed pretty angry that we didn't know french. The french breakfast was pretty basic too, and they have portions that are way too small.\n\nSunday was the hike up to the Creux-du-Van which was a very steep hike, but an amazing view from the top. Photo's will do a better job of explaining it, so look on the Picasa web album.\n\n\n\nWe hiked down to the other side where there was a gorge, and then walked along the creek/river for a few hours to the train station and then went home.\n\nI saw my first Swiss Person give the finger at the train station, as Michael decided to run across the tracks when there was a train coming instead of using the underpass. The train driver was not happy as you can imagine so it was undertanable. Still strange that none of us had seen anyone give the finger until now.\nAlso funnny was that there was some girls at the other side of the train station dancing, that didn't realise we could see them. When they turned around I waved and they ran away embarrassed. Then they decided they liked the attention after all and came back and continued. I think Petr enjoyed it.\nWe caught some more delayed trains on the way home, the reputation of always being on time has been wrong nearly every train this last month, SBB needs to pick up there game.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/iaeste-jura-weekend/","title":"IAESTE Jura Weekend"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/iaeste-liechtenstein-weekend/":{"body":"This weekend I went on an IAESTE trip to Lichtenstein. It was a hard decision this weekend whether or not to go to Lichtenstein or stay and go the the street parade in Zurich on Saturday night. In the end I'm glad I went away for the weekend, although the street parade would still have been a sight to see, but I had a great time in Lichtenstein. As we waited for the train to Sargans on Saturday morning, we even saw a few people that were in dressed in costumes for that night.\nIn our train carriage there was a group of guys having a buck's party, with the groom to be in a cow suit. His friends set him the challenge of climbing into the luggage rack and pulling himself along the entire length of the carriage (we took our bags down so he could do this) and then he had to do a shot at the end.\n\nWe then got a bus from Sarrgans to Vaduz, Lichtenstein. We went for a walk along the Rhein, which was quite unimpressive, it wasn't a particularly exciting river, but it marks the border between the two countries. We then got a bus up to the town of Malbun which was much more scenic. From here we went for a hike (well Steven and I) up a small creek that fell had been lined with logs, and kind of looked like a staircase.\n\nWe went to a falcon show in the afternoon where a man showed us many huge birds, and explained interesting facts about them in German. He did translate some to English for us though when he brought them over towards our table. One falcon in particular was huge (15kg), and it was cool to see the hawk death strike a fake bird on a string. There was also a raven which once let out went crazy flying onto everyone's table and stealing their food. One table had some ice cream which it ate and had ice cream on it's beak which looked hilarious.\n\nWe then went for another hike, but at this stage some fog had appeared so we couldn't see much which was a shame. I sure the view would have been spectacular but it just looked like cloud to us.\n\nWe then got a bus back to the city, ran back along the river to the hostel, went to dinner at a restaurant, then decided we should make our own street parade. So we found a service station to buy some beer then explored the streets of Vaduz. We found a band that was playing (no doubt because of the festival the next day) that sounded descent. I think every song they played was in English, but the banter was in Swiss-German. As the night went on we knew more and more songs. They were actually really good and had various singers throughout the night who were all very good. A girl came round and gave out sparklers, which we lit and then got told we were children and that we were supposed to wait for \"the song\". So she gave us new ones to hold in the air during some song later on.\n\nSunday was Lichtenstein's national holiday, and the prince holds an aperitif in his garden that is open to the public. First there was some sort of mass on a field by Vaduz Castle. It was kind of eerie at one stage when they all chanted the Lord's prayer or something in German. People all speaking in unison in a foreign language felt like we had stumbled upon some sort of cult ritual.\n\nAfter the mass, the prince's son gave some speech about politics and stuff and then they all marched up to the castle. Also the band played God Save The Queen at the end which was just strange because they aren't part of the Commonwealth.\n\n\n\n\nThe aperitif was awesome. There was free food and beer, and we got got to explore the garden of the castle. Also we met the Princess, the Prince and the Prince's son and got photos of them all with us and the IAESTE flag. They seemed like a nice family and it was cool that they spend the morning talking to everyone. I also got to have a go of an alpine horn, which they had set up on a hill.\n\nWe then walked down the mountain to the city, where there is a festival for the national holiday. All museums and buses are free on the day. I learnt that I don't understand modern \"art\" as some of the stuff in the museum was just silly and anyone could do it. There was a cool quilt thing though that was a map of the world with each country shown as the national flag. But mostly it was silly things like a pile of coal, or a canvas that someone had put a stripe of black paint on with a paint roller.\n\n\nThe bands and entertainment didn't start until like 6.30, and about 5.30 it started to rain and got very miserable so we decided just to head home, as nothing particularly exciting was happening.\n\nAll in all it was a fun weekend, and it's not every day you get to meet royalty.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/iaeste-liechtenstein-weekend/","title":"IAESTE Liechtenstein Weekend"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/iaeste-rafting-weekend/":{"body":"\nWhitewater rafting was really fun, but I must say it would have to be better in Australia purely because the river we rafted down consisted of 4 degree glacial water.\nAfter wet-suiting up, we caught a bus up into the mountains where we were told about all the safety rules and told what to do for each of the commands from our guide. Our guide \"Dougie\" was from NZ and quite a funny lad.\nThe water was absolutely freezing. Our hands all went numb within a minute or so. After a few minutes it wasn't so bad as you could no longer feel anything.\nThe first rapids were quite intense and lots of fun, and by the time we had to hop out (because there was a section that is Class 5) I was used to the water. The first section was down the Black LÃ¼tschine, and we had to hop out just after this river joined with the White LÃ¼tschine, which was just awesome when they met. Something to do with the rocks that the glaciers are on, one river is white(ish) and one is black(ish - more grey) but when they meet there is a distinct colour difference down the middle of the river until they slowly merge.\nThe first leg was Class 3, and the last section was Class 4, which was just insane fun. It didn't last too long though and then the last bit was just cruising down the river towards the lake. Because the water level was so high we had to limbo under a few bridges which was cool, some were like 50cm between the bottom of the bridge and the water.\nWe all hopped out for a bit for a swim, which was fun for like 2 seconds and then just like going for a swim in ice. But being pushed by rapids felt cool, but we all hopped back in the raft as quick as we could.\nWe ended up coming out into one of the lakes, which is like 850m deep according to our guide. We put our hands in the water and you could feel an immediate change in temperature once we paddled out of the way of the river mouth.\nWhere we loaded the rafts back on there was a family of swans, with the parent swans trying to attack anyone that came too close. Was amazing to see.\nWe then went back to the rafting place for a free beer and some cheese.\nAfter rafting we went back to the hostel for dinner, then to the coop (like Woolworths or Coles) to buy beer (in single cans). It feels so weird being able to drink in the street, especially as one stage there was a big group of us walking past some police with beers in hand.\nWe then went to some lobby/bar thing that I'm not really sure what it was, and there was a St.Bernard at the front. There was also a dog inside at the bar that was walking around looking for pats. Was quite strange to see.\nLater on we heard some loud noise and everyone stopped talking to witness some random people walk in with giant cowbells - video on Facebook. We then realised that there was a wedding going on in one of the function rooms.\nThe next day we got a train up into the mountains to see a waterfall. The TrÃ¼mmelbach GletscherwasserfÃ¤lle was easily one of the coolest things I've seen in my life.\nIt is where the water comes from for the white river that joined the river we rafted, and is 2 degrees, it comes from a glacier way up above although we couldn't even see it from down the bottom. I think most of it comes from the Jungfrau.\n\n\n\nAfter the waterfall, we went up to MÃ¼rren via cable car, and then hiked back down. It was a very cool walking track with random waterfalls the whole way down, but had very sore knees by the time I got to the bottom. It was also weird that at the bottom of the mountain it was 25 degrees, and when we hopped out of the cable car at the top it was like 17 degrees - felt like walking into air-con but outside.\n\n\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/iaeste-rafting-weekend/","title":"IAESTE Rafting Weekend"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/iaeste-ski-weekend/":{"body":"\nSo this weekend was the much-anticipated IAESTE Ski Weekend.\nAfter finishing work on Friday, I went to Karla's Goodbye Apero for a little while and then had to get a train to Les Diablerets. The journey takes 3 hours and 40 minutes, and after each subsequent train change there were more and more IAESTE peeps. At about 10 we finally got to our destination, and upon arriving to the chalet we got some GlÃ¼hwein, or rather Vin Chaud because we were in the French-speaking part. It tasted different to the one I had in ZÃ¼rich but it was also really nice.\nOn Thursday night I had not got much sleep because I went to the work Christmas party in ZÃ¼rich, and Friday night we stayed up late as well, considering we had to get up early the next day. I think our room was one of the first to go to bed at about 1, and I could still hear music blaring when I went to sleep. The best thing about staying in a chalet and not a hostel like all the other weekends was that we were allowed to make us much noise as we wanted.\nOn Saturday morning we split up, and those without their own gear had to go to the rental store. I was convinced into renting a helmet for the weekend by the fact that everyone else had one, unlike in Davos where Maciek and I went without.\nWe had to get a bus from the town up to the gondola, and then headed up to the glacier. I had a pretty horrible morning as the board felt weird for some reason and I was uncomfortable with the turns. After lunch I realised that my bindings were a bit loose, and thought that maybe it was that, but wasn't really sure how to fix them or where to get the tools, so I soldiered on.\nBefore lunch we had stayed close to the restaraunt. There was only one really short red (blue) run and to use another run you had to walk (or get lots of speed to get past the flat part) over to the T-bars. After lunch we walked across, but I did two more runs and decided that it wasn't me that sucked and that it was definitely the bindings. So then I had to hike back again to the restaraunt and was able to find a table where they had tools and tighten my bindings. It was instantly better, and so I was pretty annoyed that the rental company was such a failure and didn't tighten them properly.\n\nI went back over to the t-bar section again and did a long blue run which was insanely fun. The resort was fairly small and was basically all blue (green) runs because the black runs were closed. But even so, I found it much better than Davos as the snow was softer and the runs more interesting. There was a bank of fresh snow on the sides of this run which allowed you to get air and land in fresh powder. I landed some of my attempts at jumps and failed hard on others but only got to do one run before it was basically time to head back up to catch the Gondola.\nAt the flat section where you needed to un-clip, they had dog sleds, and at the end of the day the dogs pulled the sled up this massively steep hill back up to the restaurant - which was pretty crazy to see.\nBack at the chalet, we had Fondue for dinner. The punishment for dropping the bread into the cheese was that you had to go out into the snow and make a snow angel. But nobody did that, so either nobody dropped it (unlikely) or they didn't follow the rules.\nThe chalet had really small ceilings (as seems to be the case all over Switzerland) and I hit my head several times. But not as bad as Curran, who bumped his head so hard that he started bleeding and had to go to the doctor because he got a concussion. After that I was much more careful and didn't hit my head once.\nAfter dinner we had a trivia night, with drinking games in-between rounds. I had not seen a few of the games before, so I can enlighten everyone when I return with lots of new games.\nSince my bindings were tight now, Sunday was probably my most enjoyable day on snowboarding to date. The weather was really good (for most of the day) and the snow was reasonably fresh and so pretty soft. I headed straight over to the slope from the afternoon before, and this time managed to mostly land a 180 air. I say mostly because I landed it but didn't stay upright for long afterwards. It was a good thing that I rented a helmet because my second attempt ended even worse.\nThings got more adventurous from there and I went to the Terrain Park with an English guy called Pete. Unlike the previous run, the terrain park was not soft snow and hurt a fair bit when I fell. The jumps weren't too scary though and I managed to get a fair bit of air off them although didn't try any tricks.\nI decided to have a go at the grind rail, and got about half way along before jumping off. On the 2nd run, I did a wider rail and was able to make it all the way to the end and do a jump off the end. This made me a bit too cocky though I think, as I tried the thin one again immediately after it and failed epicly. Again I was glad I had rented the helmet as I hit my head pretty hard on the ice.\nThen later still, I did another epic stack. I hit the biggest jump with tonnes of speed and without meaning to attempted to do a backflip - or at least that's what I was told it looked like by Pete. I basically landed on my back so it I landed pretty hard and got the wind knocked out of me a bit. After a short breather I was okay, see the video below for footage that I took directly after (in the middle of the video somewhere). I had planned on doing the rail again but didn't want to try it with the camera in my hand. We went back one more time though and I successfully made it to the end of the grind rail again, again landing the jump off the end.\n{{&lt; vimeo 17814190 &gt;}}\nWe went back to the nice soft runs after that and tried doing Indie grabs. All and all it was an epic day, and was a much better ski resort than Davos. The one problem that I had was that the T-bars were so long and steep that it was really quite painful by the time you go to the top of them.\n\nAt the end of the day we went back to the chalet for some hot soup and then started the long train journey home.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/iaeste-ski-weekend/","title":"IAESTE Ski Weekend"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/iaeste-ticino-weekend/":{"body":"We caught a train from Zurich to Airolo, which took a few hours. Along the way we played Chinese Whist (what we just called hearts at Ergon) whilst going though the Swiss Alps. Some of the views were pretty cool, but there was lots of tunnels, and tunnels are boring.\nIn Airolo we got rental bikes and started a 40km (something like that) bike ride to Biasca. It was mostly downhill through the Swiss Alps but was still tiring by the end. At lunch we stopped at Faido and there was an awesome waterfall. Continued riding along the river and huge mountains, and then another stop later at the mining exhibit. They are building a train tunnel underneath the swiss alps, and had an exhibition showing all the mining equipment and how they blow the rock up and such. Then more riding until we got to Biasca and caught the train to Lugano.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Lugano we were staying at a very cool Hostel, which was also a Hotel so it had a pool and lots of palm trees and other nice stuff. We went to dinner at some restaurant next to the Hostel with Astin Martin car posters all over the wall and had what looked like Fish and Chips with Veggies, but was actually chicken.\nWent to the shop and bought a \"Swiss Beer\" then went down and explored the town and lake. Looking across the lake someone thought that Italy was on the other side, so we looked it up on google maps to find that it was indeed Italy.... but then it went back into Switzerland again. Have a look on a map and it's quite strange. It's called an enclave apparently. See here on google maps to see what I'm on about.\n\nOn Sunday we went out on paddle boats on the lake. Not something I would have chosen to do normally but it ended up being really fun. At first we played pirates and hi-jacked each others boats. In the process of which I lost my sunglasses into the lake, and also Ben (from Canada) broke a seat of the boat trying to throw me overboard.\nThe boat I ended up on (not my original boat) went for a 30min paddle to the other side of the lake (but not to Italy as we were told we weren't allowed to) to try and paddle under a huge fountain... which we did. And it was cold. Also really fun.\nWhere we were paddling they were also setting up the fireworks on a boat for that night's firework show (as it was Swiss National Day).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe ate lunch in the park then a few of us went for a walk along the lake to see how far it went around the headland, and saw some guys jumping off a bridge. One guy was crazy and jumped off a rock that was about 3m in from the water and had to dodge all these tree branches to get though.\n\nIn the afternoon we got the funicular (like a cable car train) to the top of Monte San Salvatore and got a 360 view of the area. There was a fairly (there was a plaque thing from the 1800's on the wall) old church at the top, which is a long way to go if you live at the bottom of the mountain (there was no houses on the way up).\n\n\n\n\n\nThen back down and to an Italian Pizzeria for dinner. The pizza I got was a Calzone something which was basically just salami and cheese, but tasted very nice. They had like 3 different types of cheeses in it and it worked well. Also because it was a Calzone it was like folded in half and cooked that way, which I'd never heard of but looked pretty cool.\nThen fireworks afterwards, we jumped the fence to the park which was locked and watched from in there, so got to sit down and have front row seats. Was very different to the fireworks in Zurich but still incredible. Afterwards one of the boats was on fire (probably the fireworks boat) so we watched the police boats try and put it out (took them a while).\n\nEven when it was finished it was cool to watch the lake as hundreds of boats all left at once and  you could see all the lights. They were all honking there horns and letting of their own fireworks as well.\nNext day was bungee, then swimming in the Verzasca River afterwards, which reminded me of stoney creek but was much much prettier and also way colder. There was a 13m high bridge that people were jumping off but I was happy jumping off a rock next to it, that was probably only 7m high.\nApparently the water was 10m deep just below the bridge, and as we were leaving some guys started scuba diving in the water, so it must have been. The water was so clear you could still see the bottom though.\n\n\n\nThen a bus to the bottom to the mountain, a train to some other town that had a huge castle on the hill that we didn't have time to look at then back to Zurich and then Turgi by about 10.30 that night.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/iaeste-ticino-weekend/","title":"IAESTE Ticino Weekend"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/iaeste-zermatt-weekend/":{"body":"Saturday I got the train to Visp to begin the IAESTE Zermatt Weekend, which very unusally for a swiss train arrived about 5 mins late. From Visp we went on a cog train up to Zermatt, which was a lovely town at the foot of the Matterhorn.\n\nWe got a cable car up to the top of the Klein Matterhorn which must be an epic ski resort in winter because they had runs open in the middle of Summer and there was a fair few people up there skiing. The side of the Matterhorn visible from up the top was covered in cloud, so we couldn't see it, which sucked. The snow up the top was somewhat fresh, so we were able to make snowballs and people started putting snow down everyone's back. One really cool thing is that from the top you can ski across to Italy (but you need an international ski pass).\n\n\nFrom the top we got an elevator back down into the mountain to the ice palace. It was pretty nice but not too impressive. One thing that was just crazy was they had a display about glacial fleas, and a microscope to see these fleas that can live in the ice. There was a part that looked like a slide exit, but we couldn't find the start of the slide so we climbed up the ice slide and found like a service room where the power boards and such were. So obviously it wasn't a slide, and it wasn't as easy to slide down it as it looked.\n\nFrom here we got the cable down below the snow line and went into the gorge. It wasn't particularly exciting although the wooden walkway along the gorge was quite cool, if a bit unsafe looking.\n\nOn the Saturday afternoon there was like a choir singing in the street at Zermatt, and the next morning there was a band of 5 alpine horns players which was amazing to listen to. Also on the Saturday night there was fireworks. I'm not sure if there was a festival on or something or if they always have things like that for the tourists but there was some sort of fun run or marathon on the Sunday morning as well, so perhaps it had something to do with that. After the fireworks on the Saturday night, we went down into the city and went to a bar which was also quite busy and fun.\n\nSunday we got a train to Brig, then a cable car up the mountain to what was clearly another ski resort (in the winter). From here we split into three groups. Option 1 was a way too easy walk, Option 2 was a medium hike around the mountain/glacier. Option 3 was to hike up the top of one mountain peak then hike to the next mountain peak, which is what I chose because I wanted to go to the top.\nMap of hiking trails:\nhttp://www.eggishorn.ch/jwa/VFS-DFA-217653-Aletsch_Arena_DF.pdf\nThe first peak we climbed was awesome and the hike up was really fun. It was such a strange mountain in that it was essentially just a pile of lots of small rocks, but made hiking up it a very cool experience. From here we hiked down the mountain on the other side then across and up to the peak of the next mountain Eggishorn (2926m). From here there was a magnificent view of the glacier and of the Jungfrau.\n\nBy this stage we had taken about an hour longer than they (IAESTE organisers) had expected it to take, and we were supposed to have met group 2 at a lake down the bottom by 3:00, when it was now 4.00 and we were still at the top. We could try and catch them up, or walk back a little bit to a chair lift and beat them back, but miss the walk past the glacier. Thinking of the stories, we went down from this peak to the bottom at the lake, or at least were supposed to but it wasn't actually a path so we spent ages descending down this mountain and didn't get to the path at the bottom until about 5:20.\n\nThe last gondalla down the mountain back to Fiesch was at 6:00 and we still had to walk what we were told was 4km past the lake, through a tunnel and then to the gondalla. With only 40mins until the last trip we needed to run to make it, so I ran most of the way, so didn't get a great look at the glacier but the path was beatuifal so I did stop a few times to look.\n\nRunning at such a high altitude was really hard and tiring. I got to the end of the tunnel at about 5:55 so thought I had made it in time, but the cable car was nowhere to be seen once I emerged from the tunnel, and after running around the bend in the track I realised I'd missed it so then gave up. The view from that side of the tunnel was nowhere near as good which was a bit of a bummer, because I could have taken my time more on the other side. So I waited for a few more people to catch up and we were resigned to the fact we would have to walk down the mountain and probably would be sleeping at a train station. We talked to a local lady who walked past, who had also not realised the last car was at 6:00 until it was too late (they changed the timetable that day).\nOur choices were to hike down the mountain, which would take about 1.5 hours according to the local lady, or she was going to walk along the path for another 1.5 hours to the next cable car station which was open until 10. So we waited for about 20mins for the rest of group to catch up, then continued to the gondolla station because there was 3 guys ahead of me that were probably waiting there.\nOne guy actually made it there by 6.05 or something after running non-stop for the whole 40mins which is amazing. So he made the last gondolla. But the other 2 in front of me where waiting still, as didn't make it to the cable car until 6:20. Luckily for us, the guy working there had agreed to take everyone down\nwith him when he finished, because as well as our group there was about 10 other people (including the lady we talked to) had not made it or not known that 6.00 was the last trip. So we were really lucky and happy that we didn't have to hike down, and that we didn't try before checking at the cable car station.\nWe made it in time to catch trains home, and I arrived in Turgi at about 11:50, which wasn't too bad considering we thought we wouldn't make it back. Most the trains we got were late, and we had to run to make the next connection at each station. I don't know why there were all so late yersterday, normally trains arrive on the dot in Switzerland.\nDespite putting sunscreen on twice during the hike, I am massively burnt all over today, as it was a really hot day yesterday and the sun was really bright. I didn't think it was possible to get burnt here, after spending a few days walking round cities in the sun with no suncreen and hat and not getting burnt at all, but now I know it definitely is. It was only something like 20SPF suncreen that I could find here, so that could have had something to do with it.\nAll in all, a great weekend, but I would have liked some more sleep.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/iaeste-zermatt-weekend/","title":"IAESTE Zermatt Weekend"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/ice-skating-in-zurich/":{"body":"\nI'll take a short break from the Euro Trip story to tell you about my first time ice skating.\nI went into ZÃ¼rich last night with a few other guys from IAESTE to go ice skating at the Dolder Ice Rink. The rink itself was so much cooler that I was expecting. Not only is it an open rink, but in the centre they had a massive lit up Christmas tree. On one side there was an ice hockey game and on the other some curling was taking place. It was a very cool set-up considering it's not even Winter yet.\nIce skating itself was surprisingly easy. If you know how to roller-blade, you know how to ice skate. I haven't done rollerblading in a long time (since the Frenchville skate nights in primary school probably) so it took me a little while until I was confident again, and stopping is a little bit different. All and all though I found it fairly easy.\nEventually we got tired of skating round in laps, and played various versions of Ice-skating tiggy. This caused me to have my only stack of the night, trying to be tricky and evade the guy that was about to tag me. On the other hand I was quite proud of my evasion skills on many other occasions in which I was able to get away from seasoned skaters. In the last half an hour or so I tried doing some tricks like spinning and stuff and was starting to make some progress before we had to leave.\nThe location of the actual rink is an amazing one, it's on a hill looking over ZÃ¼rich and the lake, and was next to this fancy hotel/apartment thing that we were told costs $16,000 a night. The bad thing about the rink, was it is a long way from Turgi when you are coming home at midnight on a work-night, so I think next time I will find one a little closer to home.\nAlso I should mention that this afternoon I bought some roasted nuts in Baden from one of the many stalls that have started to pop up in the last month or so. They were pretty expensive but I wanted to see what the fuss was about, as they seemed to be getting a lot of business. They were quite good, they tasted a bit like Macadamia nuts, so imagine them roasted a bit and that's what they tasted like. I forget what the type of nut was called, something also starting with M. Still it's a pretty cool idea, more interesting than a hotdog stand.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/ice-skating-in-zurich/","title":"Ice Skating in ZÃ¼rich"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/jakobshorn/":{"body":"\nOn Sunday my housemates and I went on a roadtrip to Jakobshorn in Davos. When we got to Davos we went to the rental store and I got a brand spanking new Snowboard for the day. After we had our gear we headed up a cable car, up another cable car, and then finally we were at the top of Jakobshorn (2590m).\nSwitzerland is a bit different to Aus/NZ - they have a different colour scheme. Blue is Leicht (easy), Red is Mittelschwer (Intermediate) and Black is Schwer (Difficult). They don't use shapes either, just the colours. So there was no double black diamonds to be conquered.\nBut everyone was fairly inexperienced (except the Americans on the skis) so we started on the blue run. This run was long but boring. Unlike Perisher and Queenstown, they don't have any trees or anything along the path to make it exciting. Just snow, snow and more snow in all directions. The run was really icy too and very painful to fall on. I didn't fall too much at the start but as I started to get tired in the afternoon I was subjected to more and more pain. Veering off the run (outside the markers) it suddenly turned to powder! Yay, except on a snowboard that means that unless you balance it right you stop moving and fall over. While this doesn't hurt in powder, I soon got very tired of maneuvering out of the powder back to the main path and kept inside the markers from then on. The ice was less fun and more painful but I didn't have enough energy to keep attempting the powder.\nOne thing that was a huge improvement on past experiences though was the lifts. They had a windshield like plastic front that you can pull down which we dubbed \"Climate Control\". It was much more enjoyable than being blasted by a freezing wind. They also had benches at the top that you could sit down on and strap in your boots.\nAfter going down the blue a few times we were ready for something different, and did a red and then a black. I must say the black was pretty disappointing. You would expect a black run in the Swiss Alps to be crazy difficult, but as there was no trees anywhere it just means that it was steeper then the other runs. Also it was very icy and hurt a lot the one time that I fell. It is still very early in the season as well, so maybe that is why everything was so icy and painful - I'm still sore today.\nThe lifts closed quite early and so we got the last cable car back at 4:45 and drove home. It was a great day, but I must say I thought the runs in New Zealand and Perisher were more enjoyable. I am going to Les Diablerets for an IAESTE weekend and staying in a Chalet, so the Swiss Alps still have a chance to prove me wrong. It should be great, and now I've had a bit of a warm-up snowboard hopefully there will be less stacks.\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/jakobshorn/","title":"Jakobshorn"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/more-snow/":{"body":"\nIt started snowing again this afternoon, so I was able to take a few photos while the snow was still fresh &amp; unmelted, and before it got too dark. It gets dark so quickly now - it's like I'm living in a completely different town.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/more-snow/","title":"More Snow!"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/my-first-snowman/":{"body":"\nThe other day I tried to make a snowman but the snow was glorious powder and didn't want to stick together. Today it was (according to the Internet) 1Â°C and the snow was starting to melt a little bit. Now that it was a bit melted I used the last chance I had before it melts away completely to attempt to make one before I go home.\nMaking a snowman is HARD WORK. The process was pretty simple, just make a ball to start with then roll it around, but once it gets a bit bigger it gets REALLY HEAVY. I wanted to make it life-size so just kept going until it was too heavy to push anymore. I was pretty happy with the base so then I made another for the next part.\nOnce I had pushed it up to the base, I realised something. This thing was hard to push so it was going to be really hard to lift. Attempting to lift it achieved nothing. I tried a few different things but eventually got it up on a chair... well half of it. If you look at the photos you will see that when I lifted it up the ball broke in half. In any case it was up, and I was pretty happy and exhausted. From then on it was easy again, trying to re-attach the parts that fell off and make it more round looking. You can see in the photo above the final product.\nThe snow was already starting to melt in the afternoon, so I don't think it will make it through tomorrow. Now the sun is down it's a bit colder again so it least it will make it through the night. If it starts to melt tomorrow I'm not sure if I should wait and see how long it can last or put it out of its misery and kick it's head off. I'm not sure if that's a common thing to do over here but when it was finished I pictured someone stomping on a sandcastle and wondered if they did the same thing with snowmen.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/my-first-snowman/","title":"My First Snowman"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/naturhistorisches-museum/":{"body":"\nWhilst aimlessly walking around the city, I saw in tiny writing on the door that one building was a museum, so had a mosey inside.\nThere wasn't anything particularly special in it, but was definitely worth looking around. It was mostly filled with life-like animal displays, which looked like they were stuffed versions of the real thing, but I'm not sure if they all were. It also made it hard to understand what I was looking at sometimes, when all the information was in German.\nThere was a few cool displays though.\nThere was a few skeleton's and fossil's which were interesting...\n\nAnd they had a microscope set up which you could move around and look at these eggs up-close. A really cool idea, but I didn't find them much more interesting when magnified.\n\nThey also had a giant ant-farm. I saw 2 that were making a break for it and had escaped, but that's still a pretty good design that only 2 had escaped when all the tops are open. You couldn't really see too well in the nest, and couldn't see any eggs or larvae or anything. There was cabinet underneath that was locked which I assume they can open up and you can look at it on tours or something.\n\nDon't know what this is, but it's a freaking huge, scary-looking bug that could probably take a large chunk out of you.\n\nThere was corridor made out of mirrors that was incredibly trippy.\n\nI'm assuming this represents blood diamonds? They had some really cool looking rocks, with some crazy formations.\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/naturhistorisches-museum/","title":"Naturhistorisches Museum der Burgergemeinde Bern"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/neuhausen-am-rheinfall/":{"body":"\nSo last night I went to Asako's Fondue party at her house in Neuhausen. We ate lots of cheese and drank lots of beer.\nBram had his Cantus books from a Belgium Party he threw during the week, so we sang some songs and watched some youtube videos for a bit, but then we moved on to Beer Pong.\nI've seen Beer Pong several times in American movies, but never actually played it. It started out as a kind of fun game, but then we picked it up a notch and changed it to \"Speed Beer Pong\" and it became much more fun. All the while cranking some JJJ.\n\nThis morning I went and checked out the Rheinfall. It was a pretty impressive sight. I would like to have seen it in the Summer when there was more water, but it was still raging fairly feircly. Also because of the snow, the observation deck was closed. Snow makes everything look cool, and waterfalls are no exception.\nThe nearby town of Schaffhausen was also cool, and today they were having a Christmas Market. Santa was there with a hooded helper lady and his donkey, and I think he might have been handing out bread to kids. It seemed a bit strange, but it's definitely better than just having someone sit in a shopping centre.\n\nThe best part of Schaffhausen was the Munot. It was different to any of the other castle's I have been to, and there was no touristy feel to it. They had some deer living outside the castle as well, one of which had a massive antler. Actually I forgot to mention that when we went to Davos we saw a massive deer with a huge antler walking across a field as we drove past.\n\nThere was also a herb garden at the MÃ¼nster which was covered in snow, so looked like all the other gardens. I think it must be cool in Summer though.\n\nNothing too exciting to tell, but it was a lovely area and probably one of the best Swiss towns I've been to.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/neuhausen-am-rheinfall/","title":"Neuhausen am Rheinfall"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/oktoberfest/":{"body":"\nFRIDAY\nSo the trip to Oktoberfest started with a long train ride from ZÃ¼rich to MÃ¼nchen. It went fairly quickly but, as someone brought cards, so we played a Canadian variation of Presidents and Assholes.\nAt the train station it was clear that we had arrived at Oktoberfest, as people were walking around in Lederhosen and Dirndl and there was massive Pretzels for sale everywhere. Also a big clue was the fact that many people were staggering around and one guy (who looked to be in his 40's) even fell over when he got on an escalator and only just managed to stand up again before the top.\nEventually (after much waiting around for the rest of the group) we got Tram 17 to The Tent. As we walked in it looked really cool, there was a massive bonfire with people chatting and fairy lights hung everywhere and a huge tent with the beds in it. But while it looked cool, trying to get to sleep was another story as when there was so many people in such a big tent you can hear conversations constantly throughout the night. Most of the people staying there seemed to be Australians, and while it was good to hear a familiar accent, it was quite annoying listening to people to talk about the AFL at 1:00am when I had to wake up at 7 to head to the festival. As well as that, the night was absolutely freezing, and I woke up cold through the night despite wearing my jumper to bed, being in a sleeping bag and having a blanket. The morning was just as bad and it was even colder outside.\n\nSATURDAY\nWe caught the tram at 7.30 and made our way to the Oktoberfest grounds, where there was already a lot of people heading towards the grounds. We were headed for the HofbrÃ¤u-Festzelt tent, which was basically the first tent as we walked in. Despite getting there a little bit before 8, there was already a massive line. By the time they started letting people in at about 8.30 there was an even bigger line behind us. When they opened the doors it was like a stampede, but we managed to get a table up the top of the tent.\n\n\nThe tent was pretty cool, was basically just a huge hall with tables and tables of people waiting for beer. The first beers arrived at about 9, but our table was one of the last tables to be served so we didn't get our first beer until about 9.40. Inside the tent was great fun, with lots of chanting but mostly just drinking. For some reason people were chanting the tune to Seven Nation Army most of the day, which is just strange because they weren't even singing the lyrics, just the riff. But we didn't get to stay in the tent long, because everyone upstairs got kicked out at about 11, because the tables had been reserved for a big group or something. At this stage we were still waiting for another beer to arrive but it never did. After we got kicked out, we were moved down to the beer garden outside.\n\nThe rest of the day was spent talking to various people from all over the world. One guy who was particularly funny was from England, but was pretending to be South African by putting on a pretty bad accent. I had four MaÃ (1L Beer Stein) during the day, so from around 3ish when I left the tent my memory isn't super detailed. I started making my way to find The Cat Empire concert that was on that night, and headed into the Oktoberfest grounds. There was a huge big statue which was really impressive, but while I thought it was cool at the time, I didn't take as much notice until we came back the next day. I ventured into town and found a supermarket and bought some food. At this point I didn't even want to go to The Cat Empire anymore, all I wanted to do was sleep. But I knew I would regret it the next day if I didn't go, so from here I randomly found my way to Feldherrnhalle looked around for a bit at all the cool statues and buildings and then got a bus to Ostbahnof. From here I started trying out my German speaking skills by asking everyone where TonHalle was. Nobody seemed to know where it was, except for one lady who sent me in the general direction, but eventually I found some people that were heading to the concert as well so followed them.\n\nThe actual gig itself was epic. Despite having a massive headache by this stage and struggling to keep my eyes open I was that tired, it would put it up there as possibly the best live show I have ever seen. It's a tough call to say whether it was better than Xavier, but I think it just makes it.\nThe support band Tinpan Orange was pretty good, and Harry Angus played trumpet and keyboard for them (he must be in like 4 bands). The cat empire where everything I expected though, they had so many improvised solos with perfect timing. Harry did this massive scat solo thing that you could tell was all improvised, and you could see how much the band was concentrating to match his timing, which was perfect for every beat. There encore was the Wine Song and the Chariot both of which were also incredible live.\n\nFinding my way home after the gig was horrible. I had a massive headache, didn't know what bus to get and was basically falling asleep as I walked. After staring at a map for a while and still having no idea, I decided to backtrack and head to the Haftbanhof and then get Tram 17.\nOn Tram 17 I was really struggling to stay awake and started dozing in and out of sleep. The night before, our group had been arguing about whether we hopped off at Romanplatz or the Botanical Gardens. I opened my eyes at one point of my half-sleep and saw I was at Romanplatz, so I quickly jumped of the train because I didn't want to miss my stop. It was actually two stops early, so I had a further 10min walk or so to get to The Tent. But eventually, I made it back and went straight to bed. Unlike the previous night, getting to sleep was no problem and I had the best nights sleep you could imagine.\nSUNDAY\nThe next day I felt great, but was I no way keen for heading back to the beer tents. No body else was in the mood for more drinking either, so we decided to go on the free walking tour of Munich.\nThe walking tour was so good, and so much better than just wandering around the city like I have been doing. So many things we saw that we would not have known the significance of otherwise.\nWe saw the outside of the Devil's Church, but couldn't go inside because there was a service on. But, we did get pointed out to us the solid gold brick that was in one of the towers, which was put there to show how lucky it was, as the church was hit by a bomb during the war that bounced off and didn't detonate.\nWe walked along the route that the Nazi party took when they first tried to seize power and saw the spot where Hitler was shot at. His body guard took 11 bullets, and saved him and now (according to our guide anyway) there is a storm water drain there to signify the spot. To demonstrate how much better having a tour guide is then just wandering around yourself, we were shown a spot on the wall where you could make out where a plaque used to be, but it had been concreted over. I would never have noticed this, but we were told what used to be there.\nI found this site that explains it, here's a quick excerpt:\n\"The BÃ¼rgerbrÃ¤ukeller was torn down years ago, but tourists can still see where the Nazis put a plaque on the Feldherrenhalle to honor the men who were killed there by the police. During the Nazi era, Munich residents were required to do a Nazi salute as they passed the plaque, which has since been removed. Those who did not want to give a salute to the fallen heroes would use Viscardigasse, a back alley which was nicknamed \"Evaders' Alley.\"\nWe also walked down Evader's Alley, where the stone's had been painted gold to recognise the people that stood up to the Nazi's. If the guards saw you walk down this street then they would send you off to a concentration camp because they knew you opposed them.\nBut the most interesting two stories were these:\nThe opera house was the first building ever to have a sprinkler system in case of a fire, but as it was the first time someone had invented it, they didn't think about what would happen if there was a fire in winter, when all the water was frozen. So when a fire broke out, they went to use it and it didn't work so they had to come up with a Plan B. So they ordered everyone to stand in a chain and pass down kegs of beer from the HofbrÃ¤uhaus down the street to poor on the fire. I should point out at this point that most of the breweries in Germany are owned by the government. But the problem with the plan was that out of the 120 or so kegs that were passed down only 20 made it to the fire. So the opera house burnt down. The king was pretty angry about the townspeople stealing his beer AND his opera house burning down, so he raised the price of beer as punishment and to pay for the damages. Except they all get angry about that and had a mini revolution, and so the tax was dropped. And now in Germany beer is classed as \"food\" for tax purposes so basically they don't charge any tax. But then again the government owns all the beer anyway, so you kind of do.\nAnd now for what I thought was the coolest story. For the last stop on our tour we went to see Munich's Maypole. It wasn't particularly exciting, but we were told that if you steal a maypole (these things are huge) you can hold it up to ransom to the town, and dictate the terms of it's return. Found some more info on stealing them here. People would steal the maypole of another town and then demand they throw them a party before they will give it back, or demand a certain amount of beer.\nBut the really cool part of the story is this: \"the theft in broad daylight of the Viktualienmarkt's maypole in 1964. As a ransom, the brothers Schorsch und Valentin Bauer demanded, and received, the lifelong right to a box at the Oktoberfest, since which time Box 7 in the Augustiner tent has been called the MaibaumrÃ¤uber (maypole thieves) box.\" And not only that but they demanded free beer for life as well which they get.\nAfter the tour we went to the Augistiner pub for lunch and got a Schweinshaxe (Pork-knuckle) and KartoffelknÃ¶del (Potato Dumpling) to eat and an Augistiner \"Oktoberfest\" beer. I hadn't tried either of these foods before, but they were both amazing. Especially the Schweinshaxe which was basically just a huge chunk of pork with crackling and fat throughout. The beer was less enjoyable, as I think my body was still processing the one's from the day before.\n\nAfter some food, we headed back to Oktoberfest. This was a very different Oktoberfest to the one I experienced the day before, because this time we walked around outside the tents, and didn't go inside. It was basically exactly the same as the show, but on a truly massive scale. The amount of people there was ridiculous. I managed to get in some photobombing practice, and even some boneheading that might make it on the German news.\nWe found our way to the hill with the massive statue to sit down for a while, and got to see all the people that had been drinking all morning passed out on the grass. I had found out that morning that most of the Canadians had slept on the hill at about the time when I left to find The Cat Empire concert. I was that tired, that if I hadn't of had a concert to go to, I would have probably done the same.\n\nAt one point, a guy at the top of the hill accidentally dropped a mug, and it rolled down the hill, hitting two of the passed out guys on the head on the way down. Even that didn't wake them up. We stayed there for a fair while and just watched various crazy stuff go down around us.\nAt the end of the day we had a long train home, which was even longer due to the fact that it was delayed by 40mins in Austria. Eventually though I was back in Turgi for a few hours sleep before work the next day.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/oktoberfest/","title":"Oktoberfest"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/procrastinating-like-a-boss/":{"body":"\nSo I had planned to do uni work this weekend, got next to nothing done.\nHere's some of the photos that were taken in the name of procrastination.\nI went for a walk up the mountain on the opposite side of Turgi this time.\nThe photo of me standing over a sheer cliff below looks a bit lame\nwhen you can't see the cliff...\n\n\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/procrastinating-like-a-boss/","title":"Procrastinating Like A Boss"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/prost/":{"body":"\nLast night we went to Germany for some drinks for Steven's birthday and also because some people are going home soon.

You aren't allowed to take photos so you will have to follow that link to see what it looks like, I didn't take any of my own. The photo shown is essentially the whole library, it is tiny and is much smaller than it looks in the photo.\nDespite being much smaller than I was expecting, it looked incredible. They have different books open at any one time on the display tables depending on the theme, which was music this year. They had some older transcript styles that look nothing like the music pages of today. They also had the oldest book written in the German Language. I can't remember exactly but I think it was from the year 590 and you could tell it was incredibly old. The pages were falling apart and had pieces missing and holes in them.\nIn addition to all the old books and music scripts, there was a replica of the St. Galler Globus, the original is in ZÃ¼rich. Despite being pretty inaccurate (Australia was a giant blob labelled New Guinea) it had all kinds of other things such as the constellations and a climate wheel, and I imagine would have been incredibly detailed for when it was made. Obviously I wasn't allowed to spin it, but playing with all the dials and wheel things would have been crazy if it was allowed.\nUnderneath the library in the basement there was another room that was part of the ticket I got, but it wasn't all that exciting. Lots of fragments of statues and stuff.\nThe actual church or Abbey (picture above), was one of the better one's I have seen. The roof was the same as in the library only on a massive scale. Considering how many church's I've seen now it's getting harder to find impressive ones, but this one is up there as one of the better ones.\nI walked around the rest of the town for a bit after that, but there wasn't anything too exciting to do or see.

But since I have a horrible memory and probably was way off with the number, I have gathered here some prices of random stuff in Switzerland for comparative purposes.\nOh and in case you were wondering, 1sFr = $1.04AUD.\nThese Prices are from my local shop SPAR (IGA equivalent):\nBanana's 2.95sFr/kg\nGala Apple's 4.60sFr/kg\nPotato's 4.20sFr/kg\nPasta 1.15sFr for 1kg (Cheapest one - there are ones much more expensive than this)\nYogurt 1.95sFr for 500g\nEggs (Euro not Swiss) 2.50sFr for 10\nNapoletana Pasta Sauce 3.20sFr for 400g\nHome Brand Piccante Pasta Sauce 2.95sFr for 490g\nGarlic Bread 1.70sFr\nHome Brand Frozen Pizza (Ham &amp; Mushroom) 3.90sFr for 375g\nHome Brand Corn Flakes 1.75sFr for 500g\nMilk 1.45sFr for 1L\nFor some reason the largest Milk you can get is 1L. They don't have 3L bottles. Also they aren't called \"Full-Cream\" or Lite or anything like that. They are named by the fat content, so you can get either 1.5, 2.5 or 3.5% milch.\nSausages 15-24sFr/kg\nChicken Breast 34sFr/kg\nChicken Nuggets 24.58sFr/kg\nSalami 36sFr/kg\nThese are prices from the Coop in Baden (Woolworths/Coles Equivalent)\nBanana's 2.85sFr/kg\nGala Apple's 2.40sFr/kg\nMilk 1.40sFr for 1L\nCoop Milch Chocolate 2.90sFr / 400g\nCoop Nuss Chocolate 3.80sFr / 400g\nThe Home Brand chocolate from Migros and Coop are actually quite good. Toblerone and Lindt are just expensive here as in Australia and taste the same.\nAlso, prices for alcohol are surprisingly cheap:\n15sFr for the cheapest scotch at Aldi (Muirhead's Blue Seal - 700ml)\n10fr for a 10-pack of FeldschlÃ¶sschen (cheap beer)\nAnd I remember seeing Jameson Whiskey (18 Year Old) for about 30sFr.\nI found another post that explains How much cheaper are prices in Germany? compared to Switzerland.\nThese prices are all just random ones I wrote down, so I'm sure you can find things cheaper or dearer in other places. Also take-away stuff here is MUCH more expensive than at the supermarket. For example Switzerland is the 3rd most expensive place to buy a Big Mac and I remember seeing in Baden that a 6-inch subway was about $10.\nSo take these numbers as you will, I just wanted to have them written down so that when I say \"Food is so expensive\" to someone and they ask \"How expensive?\" I can answer with something better than \"really expensive\".\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/swiss-food-prices/","title":"Swiss Food Prices"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/technorama/":{"body":"\nThis Saturday I went to Technorama in Winterthur on an IAESTE event. It was sort of like the Swiss version of Questacon. Check out the video below for some of the random things that I filmed.\n{{&lt; vimeo 17339544 &gt;}}\nThe Lightning display was a fairly big let-down for the most part (it went for about 30mins but the only cool bits were in that video). But the Tesla coils were definitely worth the wait. After Ode to Joy they also played Smoke on the Water - the frequency is changed by increasing how many times it arcs in a second.\nThe Mindball game had me really excited when I first saw it. It was pretty impressive. Until I won about 5 games in a row so we started testing the system to see how it works. Turns out the game still runs with nobody hooked up to it and the \"brain waves\" are just as random.\nThey had a transparent gearbox which was pretty cool to see how it physically worked.\nThey had a electic bike set-up similar to one we designed for a group project at uni. Except we never made ours and it wasn't as good. They had several different applicances hooked up so you could see how fast you needed to pedal to produce enough power for them to work. The LCD TV was suprisingly easy to power, boiling water and powering some LED floodlights was much more difficult.\nThey also had a table full of gas in which you could see particle collisions taking place, which were like little minature explosions, was pretty impressive.\nIt was a an educational and interesting day. At the end of the day we had a bloody freezing walk to the train station, and froze on the platform waiting for a train. I can understand why people don't like Winter here, but so far I still love the snow :)\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/technorama/","title":"Technorama"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/the-apartment/":{"body":"I'm staying at a 4 bedroom apartment at: Spinnereistrasse 4, CH-5300 Turgi\nI'm sharing with 3 other people, a guy from Poland, a girl from Germany and a guy from Czech Republic.

Thai airways was an awesome airline though, everything was very schmick but it didn't change the fact that you had to sit in the same spot for 8 hours.\nBangkok airport was pretty cool, the place was massive. As it was night time it was hard to tell how big exactly since you couldn't see outside, but it seemed to go on forever. Also they had stores selling elephant tusks, which I thought was frowned upon, but I guess not.\nThe flight with Swiss Airways wasn't as fancy but I spent most of it trying to sleep so it wasn't a huge deal.\nZurich airport was pretty cool too. They had a train between terminals and they had all these posters along the track which, because we were going so fast, made stop-motion videos of a lady waving a Swiss flag.\nGetting through customs was easy too, they didn't even check our bags, just the passport.

We only got to hear the last song but it sounded really good. The church was very nice, although not as nice as the one in Bern. One thing that it did have though was a basement with all these tombs of past bishops. And upstairs they had like a museum thing (where you couldn't take photos) with lots of old books, bibles, scrolls and stuff on display under glass cases. It was really cool to see books so old, most were from like the 1400's so hand-written and in Latin. Also they had crazy artwork with like gold foil and stuff. Incredible cool for books that I couldn't read.\n\nWe paid 4sFr to climb the tower, and there was a very nice view from the top. I hit my head several times though because people in the past must have been very short and all the doorways were tiny. There was a bell that we waited for 15min or so for it to ring, then realised it wasn't in use and we waited and had waited for nothing.\n\n\nThen to the supermarket to buy some lunch, then back to Anthony's house to eat it. After some food, we went to France and Germany! There is a monument called Three Countries Corner where the three borders meet. Besides walking across the border, didn't really go into France, but we headed to Germany to grab some beer and meat for a BBQ that night. Prices in Germany are much cheaper than Switzerland, even if it is only like 1km away.\n\nAfter shopping and some Czech beers, we returned to Switzerland and set up Anthony's BBQ by the River Rhein. An amazingly tasty BBQ ensued, and the meal tasted fantastic. The beer we brought back from Germany was a keg of Wheat Beer, which I thought I had tried before but apparently not because the taste was so different to any beer I'd had before. It was incredibly sweet and not at all what I expect beer to taste like.\n\nAfter the BBQ had to make a quick dash back to the train station to catch the last train back home.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/three-countries-in-one-afternoon/","title":"Three Countries Corner"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/trevors-farewell-party/":{"body":"When I was introduced to everyone around the office and told them I was from Australia, they all wanted to know if I knew Trevor, because he was from Australia too. He was the very first co-op from CQU to work at ABB in Turgi, and came back after graduating, having been here for the last 9 years. But he moves back to Australia next week to work for QR, so he had farewell drinks on Thursday night. I'd never met him but thought I would drop by quickly to say hello.\nA good night was had, as because I had to keep the Australian stereotype intact, I wasn't permitted to leave until we had got through all the beer he had bought. It was quite good beer actually, Badener Gold, which is brewed in Baden nearby. They were 5.2% alcohol, but was told they weren't full-strength and that that is what they consider a standard beer here. When talking about drinks here I even discovered that one Swiss guy had tried Bundy Rum, thanks to Blake Harvey bringing some over with him at one stage.\nIt was a great night and I met some cool people and heard some cool stories. Wasn't particularly fun getting out of bed at 7 the next day to get ready for work, as we stayed up well into the night, but I went to a training course and got a free lunch, Swiss-Army Knife and laptop bag, so it was still a good day at work.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/trevors-farewell-party/","title":"Trevor's Farewell Party"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/wanderweg/":{"body":"\nI've seen enough signs since being here to work out that Wanderweg means that there is a walking path this way, or the yellow diamond painted on to a tree like in the next photo. Just used google translate and the word actually translates to \"trail\" but I got the idea.\n\nSo next weekend I am doing a Rafting/Hiking weekend and it said that you need to bring hiking shoes, so yesterday I went in to the closest big shopping centre in Spreitenbach to buy some. That's actually the town I ended up at after walking home after Zurich Fest.\nSo after I bought some I decided I go for a walk up the mountain behind Turgi, as I noticed a Wanderweg sign at the train station pointing that way.\nIt was actually a really hard climb, quite steep and a very narrow path. It was quite a hot day too, so it wasn't easy going. The view from the top was quite good though, as you could see all of Turgi and Brugg and see the Limmat river.\n\nThere was also some weird rocks formation things along the way, with a really big one up the top that was like a cave.

That is not to say it wasn't a great day - just that I didn't do anything particularly Christmas-y. Or more specifically without having a meal with the rellies it doesn't feel like a real Christmas.\nBut I did have an interesting day. I went with Roderick to Mt. Rigi, near Luzern, to try Schlitteln (sledding) for the first time. The weather wasn't great and there was hardly any visibility - but at least it was a white Christmas.\nSledding was quite scary at first. Neither of us were really sure how to turn or break, and combined with the fact that the track was both steep and windy had us slightly concerned. Eventually we decided the best way to stop and turn was to simply dig your feet into the snow. I was wearing just normal shoes and socks so am very surprised that my feet didn't fall off. They were basically submerged in snow for the entire day.\nOnce we stopped trying to lean to turn and used our feet, it was much more fun, although still difficult. The snow was perfect, fairly icy on the main track but glorious powder if you strayed just a little. It meant that it was possible to get some good speed but when I failed to turn and continued off the track, I landed in soft powder.\nChristmas lunch was a measly hamburger which I bought at the restaurant at the top of the mountain, but having a GlÃ¼hwein did have some Christmas feeling to it.\nFor the last run of the day I accidentally led us on to a ski run, which was incredible fun although at one stage we did have to traipse through metre deep powder. This wasn't as fun as it sounds as there was zero visibility so we had no idea where we were going and my shoes filled up yet again with snow. Once we made it back onto some firmer snow the run was insane.\nI took some videos which I will put up probably once I have gotten back to Australia. All in all, it was a very different Christmas.\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/weihnachten-in-der-schweiz/","title":"Weihnachten in der Schweiz"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/working-at-abb/":{"body":"\nSo some people weren't sure if I'd actually started work yet, so thought I would do a post about where I'm working. I started on Thursday 1 July and finish on the 31 December.\nSo far I have mostly been reading about Simulink and the project I will be working on and settling in. Tomorrow and Friday I am doing a training course.\nWork itself seems like it will be very interesting and should be fun. ABB's official language is English, so most of the documentation and stuff is in English - but they have German keyboards with the z and y keys swapped around which keeps stuffing me up, and most of the signage and news and stuff up around the office is in German.\nAs English is the official language, everybody speaks it pretty well, although most people seem to talk in German when they can, but will speak in English when talking to me.\nI work in the third floor of this building (although I will be working in the lab later on).\n\nThe office has actual plants in it, not plastic ones like Ergon. And I'm promised that I will get some dual screen monitor action soon for my laptop.\n\n\nAt 12.30 everybody goes to lunch at the ABB restaurant. The menu is in German, but they have the meals on display so you can see what they look like. They have a different menu each day, and put it on the net.\nSo far the meals have been pretty nice, there was one that was pretty average. At least I get to try a different meal each day, and they are different to what you would probably get in Australia.

Besides this, ZÃ¼rich was as dull as usual, but it was good to have a chat to Kate. When I came back into Turgi I saw they now have Christmas lights up in the main street, which was pretty cool.\nThursday the 25th November marked one month until Christmas! They now have a Christmas tree at the restraunt at work and a big one at the train station in Turgi. And they have started playing Christmas songs on the radio at the Spar.\nI went back into ZÃ¼rich to see Kate again and the turning on of the Christmas lights in ZÃ¼rich. The lights looked awesome. I didn't actually see them get turned on, but Kate said there was a pretty underwhelming marching band and it wasn't that exciting. The lights look awesome though. The Christmas Markets were open and they were selling all kinds of Christmas ornaments and other cool stuff. It was all really expensive though.\nAll the other times I've been to ZÃ¼rich it has been pretty dull, but the white Chritmas vibe was incredible. There were people singing carols, Christmas trees and lights everywhere. We went to a stall and got some mulled wine with honey. I wasn't expecting it to like it, and just wanted to give it a try, but it turned out to be really nice.\nWe went to the IAESTE weekly meeting for a bit, then I had to go home and get some sleep before work the next day. As we were about to leave it got really cold and was starting to rain. By the time we got to the train station it got a bit colder still - enough for it to start to snow! By the time I got to Turgi it was snowing fairly heavily - although it was still a bit watery. It was by far the best walk home from the train station watching it snow with the Christmas lights all up in the street.\nThis morning everything was covered in snow. Not very good snow, it is very patchy and icy, but the walk to work was incredible.

But I took a photo of the grous for Mr Hooper and Tommy P. The drinks were real expensive but, even for clubs.\nThe pub where we got the beers was really cool, had lightbulbs everywhere on the roof, played good music (Little Yellow Spider for example) and had a cool vibe.\nThen we experienced some Swiss culture (I was out with a german and swiss guy) and bought a cheeseburger from McDonalds.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/zurich/","title":"ZÃ¼rich"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/zurifascht-2010/":{"body":"After Baden, I headed into ZÃ¼rich for ZÃ¼rifÃ¤scht, which I had no idea what it was but was something to do. Basically it was like Fire in the Sky in Rockhampton, but much, much better.\nI heard about it through IAESTE (International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience ) who organised my visa, and put on trips and stuff for everyone over here on a placement.\nOn the train I met three people in IAESTE by chance, one guy from England had even done German lessons with Quinny back when he was over here. So followed them into town and met up with some more IAESTE people, and hung out with them for the night, they were all fairly rad. Most of them are doing electrical engineering as well, so it's sort of like a multinational EUS.\nAnother crazy thing I didn't realise about Switzerland is there is no law against drinking in public, so people were cracking 6-packs on the train left right and center, and everyone was drinking in the streets. Didn't seem to cause any issues though, and even though there was millions of people in the streets everyone seemed to be having a good\ntime and I didn't see any fights or anyone acting like a dickhead, which is amazing. ZÃ¼rich is a beautiful city, as I'm sure you can tell from the photos below.\n\n\nOne more thing that is taking some getting used to is how long the daylight lasts. Being summer, I think the days lasts for 15 hours or something ridiculous. Basically I hadn't seen night time here until last night. I woke up at 6 and the sun was up and it didn't get dark until about 10 at night. Most of the photos below were taken after 9pm and it still felt like late afternoon.\nThe actual fireworks themselves were so much better than anything I had seen in the past. Unlike in Australia, they didn't just set them off randomly, it went for 30mins and was synched to music. I'll try and put up a video soon.\n\nAfter a massive walk through crowded streets back to the train station, there was two choices for a train that I could make out. A commuter train at 1.24 or an express train to Baden at 2.06. I didn't really want to wait around for an hour for the express train, so got the commuter train, not knowing at night time they don't go all the way along the line. So the train I got stopped about half way to Turgi, at Otelfinen, which was the last train of the night until 6am the next day, so I was stuck there.\nI was pretty tired and didn't want to have to wait till morning, so started walking to Baden, hoping I would get there in time to get another train. Without really knowing where I was going, I headed in the general direction along some Swiss Countryside. At one stage I was walking past all these crops and saw two foxes run across the road. This is where I actually ended up walking, which would have taken me 52mins according to google. Then luckily at the station I ended up at randomly there was a train to Turgi leaving about 2mins after I rocked up so I caught that home.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/zurifascht-2010/","title":"ZÃ¼rifÃ¤scht 2010"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/":{"body":"","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/","title":"2011"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/hai-van-pass/":{"body":"\nOur next destination was to be Hue, but this time we got to take the scenic route rather than fly.\nFirst up, we were taken to the marble mountains which had a massive stone staircase to the top, at which there was various temples and Buddhist shrines.\n\nThere was a massive cave which was used in the war to hide from the American troops. There was a hole in the ceiling where it had been bombed during the war.\n\nThere was lots of tourists at the mountains, but unlike the places we had been previously, a lot of them were Vietnamese. Lots of families asked us to get photos with them. It was as if we were celebrities - very weird.\nAt the base of the mountain were various stores at which marble sculptures were sold. They used to use marble from the mountains, but now it is imported. The sculptures were very impressive and the amount of work that must go into them is insane.\n\n\nWe stopped quickly at China Beach for a photo. It was scorching hot on that day, so we tried not to stay in the sun too long and left pretty quickly.\n\nWe stopped at a museum at which there was various Hindu statues. These were taken from various ancient temples and yet it was all there with no security. It was a pretty different experience to say the Louvre where everything is behind glass.\n\n\nTo get to Hue from Danang we travelled along the Hoi Van Pass, which had a magnificent view but was a pretty dangerous road. We overtook a petrol tanker at one stage around a blind corner and nearly hit a bus.\n\nAfter that, the road to Hue was quite uneventful. We were pretty sad to be leaving our tour guide and driver behind, as they had been super friendly guys and great to have with us.\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/hai-van-pass/","title":"Hai Van Pass"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/halong-bay/":{"body":"images: 2011-08-02-halong-bay/P1080464.jpg\nWe got a bus from Hanoi to Halong, and were joined by some other travellers, most of which were from Australia except for 3 people from New Zealand. Our guide Viet informed us that if we were lucky we might still be able to stay the night on the bay, and that they were making some calls, but that it was up to the government as they had closed the bay to all boats as a safety precaution.\nWe visited some rice paddies and another marble factory on the way.\n\nIt started to pour rain while we were at the marble factory and so we didn't have high hopes of being allowed on the boat, but our guide gave us good news when we were back on the bus that we would not only be allowed out on the boat, but they we would be staying the night.\nWe arrived in Halong to find that the weather was perfect.\n\nIn the afternoon we got to go inside a small cave that opened up inside one of the islands. We were told that there was monkeys living on the island, but we didn't see any. Then in the afternoon, we got to go for a swim - jumping off the boat into the water. I had two attempts at a front flip - both of which ended in immense pain from me doing a backflop.\n\n\nThe food was excellent, we got course after course of delicious seafood. At night we stayed up on deck drinking beer and talking to the ship crew and the captain even challenged me to a game of chess. The crew was really young and cool to talk to.\n\nThe following day we anchored at a beach, and found a track that took us to the top of the island from which there was a magnificent view - probably one of the highlights of the whole trip for me.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we were back on the mainland and on our way home, Viet informed us that they never actually did open the bay back up to boats and that in fact they had basically bribed the port authority to allow us to go out. It was super dodgy and so they hadn't told us in advance in case it made us worried. It explained why there was so little boats out on the water. It made the trip even more special as we basically had the bay all to ourselves with the exception of the local fisherman that lived out on the water. I don't think many people would have had the same experience, and when we talked to the guys that went the week before us, they told us of how there had been tonnes of boats on the water with people coming up to your boat peddling goods.\nThe bus ride back to Hanoi was fairly uneventful, with the exception of some really intense near-misses with oncoming traffic and some cows that were wandering on the road.\n\nOn our last night we went to dinner with our kiwi buddies, and had some awesome Prawn Hot Pot.\n\nVietnam was an awesome country, much better than I was expecting and I would love to go back some time and see some more of the rural areas as opposed to the cities.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/halong-bay/","title":"Halong Bay"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/hanoi-and-halong-bay/":{"body":"\nI really hated Hanoi. It was so cramped, dirty, smelly and hot. So hot in fact that Tom and I even came back to the hotel for the middle of the day to get out of the heat.\n\n\nUnlike the other cities we visited, we spent ages on the first day trying to find a cheap place to find some descent food. We expected it to be much like Saigon, but prices were a lot higher here. We had also planned to do our souvineer shopping in Hanoi so we didn't have to lug our stuff around the country, but were dissapointed to find that there was a much smaller range of things for sale and people weren't as eager to barter.\n\nWe went exploring and visited the Temple of Literature which was a university dedicated to the teachings of Confucius.\nAfter that we went to see the Ho Chi Min Mausoleum. Apparently he was mummified (against his wishes) and you can go see the body. Only on certain days though, and when we visited it was closed up with some very serious security patrolling the building ensuring nobody got close.\n\nNear the mauseleum is the Ho Chi Mihn Museum, which is a really bizarre museum that didn't make much sense. We had no idea what most of the displays were meant to represent, but it was good to be inside the air con. Outside the museum was the one-pillar pagolla, which was pretty awesome but bizarelly had some trippy rave lights inside which I thought cheapened it a bit but also made it awesome.\nSo after our big day in the heat, we headed back to hotel to find out that we had a missed call from Travel Indochina to say that there was a cyclone coming and so our trip to Halong Bay had been cancelled. Needless to say, we were pretty bummed. We were offered an alternative trip to Sapa, but neither of us were keen for a massive train ride and the potential of catching malaria. We organised to stay another night in Hanoi, and hope that the weather cleared up enough that we could still at least see Halong Bay, even if the bay itself was closed to boats.\nI was not looking forward to another day in Hanoi, but that night it rained and it became a whole new city for me. The air was fresher, the streets cleaner and most the pollution and smell washed away. We went to some markets and otherwise just walked around the city and it was a huge improvement on the day before.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/hanoi-and-halong-bay/","title":"Hanoi"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/ho-chi-minh-city-saigon/":{"body":"\nWe arrived in Saigon to see our driver out the front of the airport with a sign with our names on it, which was a bit of a luxury. However, we had barely even read the sign before he waved at us and walked off, looking back every now and then to make sure we were following. Then he pointed at the taxi pick up zone and disappeared. We were still trying to remember what he looked like when he came back with the car and we got in - it was pretty funny watching Tom trying to make small talk with the guy, as he didn't speak any English and had no idea what we were saying.\nThe traffic was exactly how we expected it, and yet it wasn't. It's just as busy as you see in videos, but somehow it all just works and for some insane reason I felt just as safe as in the traffic back home. The main difference is the sheer amount of motorbikes on the road, they were everywhere and heading in all directions.\nOur hotel was well situated in the middle of the city, and had a pretty schmick lobby. Once we got out of the elevator on our floor, we were greeted by some truly stuffy air, it was probably the stalest air I have ever tasted, even staler then when we leave the beach house locked up and air-tight for a few months. In the room it was a bit better, and we had air-con that cooled us down. We had some complimentary water waiting for us, which was a good reminder that we couldn't go trusting any tap water in Vietnam.\nWe dumped our bags and then went out to quickly explore the nearby Báº¿n ThÃ nh Markets, which had all kinds of clothes and watches for super cheap prices. There was also some epic looking food, and we saw crab being cooked on a grill in the middle of the street. The night market was literally just people set up stalls in the middle of the street, and motorbikes weaved around us as we looked at all the stalls.\nThe next day we decided to join a tour of the Chu Chi Tunnels, which was $12USD including the bus out there. On the way we stopped at a handicapped art factory, where disabled people made beautiful paintings and carvings out of duck shells and Halong Bay clams.\n\nThe actual tunnels probably wouldn't have been that exciting by themselves but when you are told the history it was incredible. The tunnels were tiny and yet the Vietcong lived underground in them for years. It would have been horrible. We saw a crater in the ground were a B52 bomb had hit, and got to crawl through the tunnels and see how small it all was.\n\nThe next day we went off to see the American War Remnants Museum. This was pretty horrifying as well. It is full of photos from the war, but worst of all for me was the Agent Orange room, which had mutated foetuses in jars showing how a lot of the babies born in the years after the war were mutated. There was photos and photos of mutated people and it explained why there was so many handicap factories across the country. It had a very anti-American feel to the place, but seemed pretty justified. Below is a tiger cage, which apparently was used to keep up to 7 people in each cage.\n\nWe then went to the Reunification Palace, where the war was ended which was the old presidential palace. It had some pretty cool rooms, the war room in the basement was quite interesting.\n\nOn our last night, we went to see a Vietnamese Water Puppet Show. It was much cooler than I expected. There was a live band that narrated the show - in Vietnamese, we had no idea what was going on but it was pretty impressive regardless.\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/ho-chi-minh-city-saigon/","title":"Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon)"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/hoi-an/":{"body":"\nAfter flying from Saigon, we arrived in Danang International Airport. It was about the size of Rockhampton airport but super dodgy looking for an 'international' airport.\n\nOur driver took us to Hoi An, and on the way we picked up our tour guide (that we did not know that we had paid for). Our guide recommended a place to get some suits made, so we headed there first. We went to a tailor called Blue, and got fitted for our suits. I just wanted a suit, and didn't much care or know what I wanted but the ladies at the shop wanted us to specify everything down to the tiniest detail, even asking us what angle we wanted our pockets to be at.\n\nAfter we chose our materials and got measured up for our suits, we got taken to our resort, the Riverside Beach Resort. It was super impressive and had an awesome view of the river, and right near the beach.\n\nAfter checking in , we tried to find somewhere to have lunch, and went to a place across the road and got some tiger prawns. Notice the clothes shop within the restaurant. It was here we first discovered the awesome local beer that is Biere Larue.\n\nAfter some lunch we headed down to the beach.\n\nTom decided in the afternoon that it was time to get food poisoning, so I chose something to read for the resort's library of clearly pirated and photocopied books and enjoyed the view of the river.\nThe next day, Tom was feeling a little bit better and we had an appointment back in the city for the first fitting of our suits, so we hired some push-bikes for the day (for $5) and went for a ride into town.\nThe traffic was much calmer than in the city, but we still had to pay close attention to everyone around us, as there was the same disregard for the road rules. Riding bikes was super fun, and we got to see a lot more of the city.\nIn the afternoon we went for a ride out of town a bit, and had some local kids run after us on our bikes yelling \"Hello\" over and over. It was pretty special because they seemed genuinely excited to see us and talk to us in English.\nAt one of the western restaurants we went to, we got Banana Pancakes. I'd never had them before but wanted to see what the fuss was about in the Jack Johnson song.\n\nWe had signed up for Red Bridge Cooking School, and part of the tour was to visit the local markets. I'm not sure if it's a good thing seeing how unhygienic everything is, but at least we knew everything was fresh.\n\nThe actual cooking class was excellent. The chef was hilarious, everything was set-up and ready to go and the food tasted amazing.\n\nAfter our cooking class, our guide took us to a local pub, where he shouted us beers that cost about 15c a bottle. We also got to try some sea snail despite being ridiculously bloated from gorging on all the amazing food we cooked earlier.\n\nA French tour guide joined us for a drink as well, as it was his birthday. A good time was had.\nOn the beach there was various jet-ski's in the water that you could hire. It was pretty fun riding along, but they were slower than I expected. Tom said the one's in Australia are much faster and more fun, as these one's had clearly been thrashed.\nExploring the city on our last night, they had lanterns floating down the river, and the whole town seemed to be out and about. It was extremely beautiful.\n\nHoi An was probably one of the highlights of our trip to Vietnam, it's very touristy (especially Australians) but still an authentic and awesome beach town well worth a visit.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/hoi-an/","title":"Hoi An"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/hottest-100-australian-albums-of-all-time/":{"body":"\nMy votes:\n\nCat Empire, The - The Cat Empire\nWhitlams, The - Eternal Nightcap\nLiving End, The - The Living End\nTemper Trap, The - Conditions\nPowderfinger - Vulture Street\nLiving End, The - Modern Artillery\nWolfmother - Wolfmother\nEskimo Joe - A Song Is a City\nGyroscope - Sound Shattering Sound\nHilltop Hoods - The Calling\n\nOthers:\nGotye - Like Drawing Blood\nJET - Get Born\nPowderfinger - Odyssey Number Five\nPowderfinger - Dream Days at the Hotel Existence\nPete Murray - Feeler\nKisschasy - United Paper People\nFaker - Addicted Romantic\nJosh Pyke - Memories &amp; Dust\nThe Dissociatives - The Dissociatives\nJohn Butler Trio - Sunrise Over Sea\nThe Grates - Gravity Won't Get You High\nGyroscope - Are You Involved?\nThirsty Merc - Thirsty Merc\nCold Chisel - East\nCold Chisel - Circus Animals\nMissy Higgins - The Sound of White\nSilverchair - Neon Ballroom\nXavier Rudd - Solace\nXavier Rudd - Food in the Belly\nEnd of Fashion - End of Fashion\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/hottest-100-australian-albums-of-all-time/","title":"Hottest 100 Australian Albums Of All Time"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/hue/":{"body":"\nUpon arriving in Hue, we had a quick walk around the city in the afternoon to see what there was to do, and made our way to the markets. They were rank, they really even worse than the one at Hoi An, which is saying a lot. We really couldn't find anything interesting to see, so we booked a tour for the next day to the outlying areas, as we hadn't planned anything and didn't no what else there was to do.\n\nTom was really keen to get a cheap massage while we were in Vietnam and as we had nothing else planned it seemed the best opportunity. I had never had a professional massage before so was up for it, but we both agreed we didn't want to go to any dodgy places where they might \"love you long time\", so we just went to the one at the hotel. Turns out it was a bit dodgy after all and we had to make it clear that we weren't looking for 'extras'. There was a Thai dance school there that night performing as well, and they made us (everyone) dance with them for a bit at the end.\nThe next day we went on our Hue tour. It didn't get off to a great start, as the air-con on the bus was broken and it was another scorcher of a day. First up was the Minh Mang Tomb. There was hardly anyone there and it was nice and peaceful compared to everywhere else we had been on this trip. There was a few cool temples but mostly it was just a huge garden.\n\n\n\nThe next tomb, the Tomb of Khai Dinh, was completely different, with no plants at all. There was some cool looking statues and the building had some incredible artwork inside.\n\n\nWe then went to see a Kung Fu show, which was super impressive. A kid did the break bricks with your head trick, and while he managed it, it clearly hurt like hell as he was rubbing his head for ages afterwards.\n\nWe also went to a village where they make Conical Hats and Incense. There was some paintings there as well, as there is all over Vietnam but I thought this one looked especially cool.\n\nThe final tomb (Tu Duc)we didn't enter, as we were told it was pretty much the same as the Minh Mang Tomb, and so we saved ourselves some money on the entry. Tom had an argument with a local, when he bought a coke and it took ages for the lady to give him change for what would have been about $50. I was pretty sure she was going to pretend that he never gave it to her, was quite amusing but concerning to watch.\nIn the afternoon, we visited the Imperial City and then the Forbidden City within. It was sad to see how much had been destroyed in the war.\n\nLast stop was the Thien Mu Pagoda. The highlight of which for Tom and I was that they had the car from the famous image of the Burning Man, as the monk had come from that temple.\n\nFrom here we got a boat back down the Perfume River to Hue.\n\nAt the end of the day, back at the hotel, Tom was talking to Lily and she asked us how our bike rides went. It was at this point that we realized that we had booked a bike tour for Hue, and that is why we didn't have anything else planned. So we wasted about $25 and missed out on visiting some local villages. Oh well, the day was so hot we were thoroughly relieved that we hadn't spent it riding pushbikes.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/hue/","title":"Hue"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/return-to-oz/":{"body":"\nWell I figured that I should probably finish off the tale of my trip to Switzerland, for the sake of completeness, even though it is now ages ago and nobody will probably read this.\nNew Years Eve was a great night, and we had an amazing Raclette dinner at the flat. After dinner we caught the train into ZÃ¼rich to see the fireworks, but even before that there was some as the people in the flat next door were letting some small ones off.\nThe train windows were all covered in paint too. It looked like it had gone past some out-of-control party. The city was packed but the fireworks display was a bit of a let down. The fireworks don't start until 12.20 so the actually midnight celebration was fairly unspectacular, although we did do traditional Russian vodka shots with Nelly's family. The fireworks were good, but not as impressive as the one's I saw on my first weekend at ZÃ¼rifÃ¤scht.\nBy the time we got home, me and one of the other house guests were not in a good state. The first time I threw up I thought it could have been the alcohol, but it didn't take long to realise that we had caught the stomach bug that the rest of the guys had caught in Austria.\nSo my 2nd last day in Switzerland was not great, consisting of being sick and packing. On January 2nd, my last day I was feeling a lot better and was ready to go. My snowman was still standing, but had lost his nose.\nThe long journey home didn't start well with the handle on my (freaking heavy) luggage not wanting to extend. This meant that I couldn't roll it along and had to drag/carry it. I was very happy to get to the airport and check it in. I got to catch the Heidi Train again to the terminal, and get on the plane. I sat next to a lovely German guy that worked in Luzern, and spent most of the 12hour flight sleeping and watching movies. I had a very sore neck and felt terrible at the end.\nI got a little concerned when I arrived at Hong Kong because they had a illness screening set up that checked you for high temperatures as you got off the plane. I still felt a bit sick but had got well enough that I got through okay.\nThere was a long wait at Hong Kong airport, then at long last I got to board the QANTAS flight back home. I was in the exit row and it was so much better. The extra leg room did wonders and was much more enjoyable than any of the previous flights. It was a window seat as well and during the night you could see stars out the window. Then in the morning as we flew in over Cairns and the Fitzroy Basin you could see how bad the flooding was. The pilot pointed out Rockhampton as we flew over but I was on the wrong side of the plane. There was a lot of floodwater upstream though.\nAs much as I loved Switzerland, it felt great coming back through customs and finally being back in Australia. Even little things like having to change back to using Australian currency at the pay phone felt good. As Rockhampton was \"an island\" as the media called it, my flight home that afternoon was cancelled, so yet more travel awaited me and at that stage I wasn't sure how or when I would be able to get home.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/return-to-oz/","title":"Return to Oz"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/returning-to-the-island/":{"body":"\nAfter going on a 12 hour flight from Zurich to Hong Kong, a 5 hour layover and then another 9 hour flight to Brisbane... I was pretty buggered. As I couldn't fly back to Rockhampton that afternoon I stayed the night with some of the Brisbane boys. Thanks to Anthony, Quentin, Jordan and Dom for letting me stay. Somehow I managed to stay awake until around 9.00 at night to try and get my body clock back in sync, at which point I basically passed out.\nThe next day I caught the tilt train, which was full of people I knew trying to get back home, including my cousin. At this stage I was carrying all my luggage around again and it was terrible. My suitcase was 23kg, my laptop bag 11kg, plus a backpack and I had to carry this all around with a suitcase that wouldn't wheel. I was glad to hand it all over to the people at QR. The train ride itself was uneventful although it was interesting coming through Bunderburg and seeing how high the floodwaters had risen to.\nI had to stay the night in Gladstone, this time thanks to Elise for letting me stay. More waiting around at the Marina, the ferry left around lunch time for Rockhampton. I was surprised at just how many people had taken advantage of the service, it was packed. The trip itself was kind of interesting, we passed through the Narrows and it is easy to see how it got it's name.\n{{&lt; vimeo 20188010 &gt;}}\nOnce we had passed through the narrows and got to the ocean you could see how much flooding there was by looking at the seawater. It was brown and full of all kinds of logs, weeds and other things washed out by the flood water. It was interesting seeing some of the tiny little islands of Emu Park that you can't see from the mainland. As well as out ferry, there were also 2 more that came from Gladstone with bread trucks on them bringing in supplies that arrived at the same time.\nAfter 5 days of straight travel, the 30min drive from Roslyn Bay Marina to Rocky felt even quicker than normal, and it was an amazing feeling to finally be home and be able to dump all my luggage and catch up with the family and Rachael. Later in the afternoon Rachael and I went to have a look at the flooding that made getting home such a big drama.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/returning-to-the-island/","title":"Returning to the Island"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/rockhampton-floods/":{"body":"\nSo the reason why I had so much trouble getting home was because of the floods.

It was very rewarding, although we went out past the heads so they could see some whales (we saw several) which caused a lot of them to get seasick.\nI was part of the Youth Crew Theatre Crew, and we dressed up in the ship costumes and performed our nursery rhyme style shanties for the guests.\nThat night we were tasked with creating a poster for our watch to go in the ship logs. I spent ages going through the past posters throughout the journey but couldn't find Rachael, David or Katherine's photos.\nWe also got to write letters to our future selves, which will be posted to us 6 months later.

On most days we had to come up on deck and do laps of the ship until everyone was up. Then every morning there is a morning brief.\nAt morning brief we heard the plan for the day from our Sailmaster Kristy, a quote from Captain Damien, an always long talk from the Navigator Matt about our current position and where we were going, as well as a visit from Nanna (Mick the Engineer in a dress and wig) &nbsp;who raided the berths for clothes/stuff left on the floor (and not neatly put away in our lockers like they are meant to be) to be shown off to everyone.\nRick was from the navy and on a suitability test, which is pretty much the greatest job interview ever. He started the first half of the journey as a youth crew like us, then about half way switched to a staff role and started running events. Every day nanna would somehow find something of his, even though he made sure it was all put away and even went as far as keeping it hidden in another room (in which case they brought up his Thomas the Tank Engine pillowcase up instead.\nSalty Seadog (Watch Office Dion) would then tell us the story behind one of the nautical terms used on the ship and finish with a pirate saying. The explanations from Salty became more and more ellaborate each day, with the rest of the staff dressing up and acting out the stories. The term for the first brief was \"SHIT\". Swearing was not permitted on board, with the exception of shit, which salty explained why. It was an old nautical term that stood for Store High In Transit, and was used on crates of&nbsp;fertilizer&nbsp;to ensure that they weren't stored below deck where the fumes would make it difficult for people to breathe. Like most of the stories Salty told us, this isn't actually true.\nAfter morning brief, nanna would teach us all a new shanty which we would have to copy. Despite being sea-themed they were essentially just nursery rhymes with different words.\nIn the morning we learnt line skills, and how to handle lines and sheets (ropes) safely and put turns on to the pins and cleats. Learning the nautical terms for everything on the ship was also something we practiced, so we could beat the other watches at the upcoming rope races.\nIn the afternoon we did some mainies in the harbour, as we learned how to set and furl the sails and tack the ship. One of the youth crew was feeling sick so we waited around for her to go ashore and see a doctor before she was came back okay and we finally got to leave the harbour.\nAs we left the heads it&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;got rougher and some of the girls started to get seasick. As we were preparing to tack the ship someone spotted a whale and so we all stopped what we were doing. Then nobody could see it so we got ready again and just as we were about to heave we saw it again and it did a massive flip right next to the ship. Talking to the crew afterwards they said that they had never seen one do a full 360 degree rotation, nor a whale get so close to the ship, so we were pretty lucky.\nUp on deck I had no signs of sea-sickness although I was finding it difficult to walk straight with the rocking of the ship, the lean of the ship was much more than I was expecting it to be (by the end of the trip we found out that the conditions on that first day were excellent and it was nothing).&nbsp;White watch was first up for dinner so we went down below to eat some nachos. &nbsp;By the time I had got my harness of I was starting to feel a bit&nbsp;nauseous&nbsp;and lining up for food I realised that might not be the best idea and headed back up deck before I spewed. As I stepped off the ladder and the breeze hit my face I felt better instantly. &nbsp;I didn't much fancy heading back down below so settled on a banana for dinner. Bananas and apples were kept up on deck in lockers and this was at a point where bananas were $18/kg or so so it was pretty lavish. We were told bananas were good to eat when you are seasick, because unlike most foods they taste the same coming up as they do going down.&nbsp;Eating the banana made me sick even though I was up on deck.\nOur first watch was that afternoon's dog watch and so we learnt how to steer the ship. Or at least Scott, Elke and I did, the rest of our watch was busy clipped on to the side of the ship being sick.\nBeing on the helm (steering) was&nbsp;surprisingly&nbsp;difficult. Because the ship is so large and heavy, there is a large delay in turning the wheel and the ship actually turning. There is also a whole new set of nautical speak to learn when working out where to steer, relative to the wind (full-and-by) or on a compass course. &nbsp;I got to see my first sunset over sea, as eventually we got out far enough that there was nothing else in sight, just water in all directions.\nThat night was a horrible night's sleep, with the rocking of the boat meaning and the seasickness meaning I didn't really sleep at all. Paul told us the trick to sleeping with seasickness was getting ready for bed as quick as possible and shutting your eyes so you don't become&nbsp;disoriented. This worked as far as I felt much better but the rocking was still to new for me to be able to actually sleep, especially with the changes of watch every few hours. We were on morning watch and so scheduled to be woken at 4am.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/v1811-day-2/","title":"V18/11 - Day 2"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/v1811-day-3/":{"body":"We were on morning watch and everyone was still pretty depressed and sick. I had another go on the helm and found it much easier second time round. Those of us that felt up to it (Elke, Rob and I - Scott despite being fine the night before was probably the sickest in the morning) climbed up with Paul to watch the sunrise.\nShortly after our watch we changed course, heading south towards Jervis Bay and instantly I felt better as we were no longer working against the swell and the rocking wasn't as severe. I was able to go down below and have lunch and unlike the previous meals most people ate. There was still a few people that were pretty sick but most people had there sea legs by this stage and were cheery again.\nIn the afternoon we had a lecture from our Nav Matt about navigation skills.\nAfter dinner, those of us from White Watch went pretty much straight to bed as tonight we had \"The Guts\" which is the watch from 12 -4.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/v1811-day-3/","title":"V18/11 - Day 3"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/v1811-day-5/":{"body":"The previous night we had an anchor watch instead of our normal 4-hour shift in which only 3 people were on watch, and only for an hour so as to keep an eye on the boat and perform rounds.\nIn the afternoon we had sail theory, and were told the purpose of each of the sails and how they affect the ship's movement. We spent the afternoon sailing around the bay, whilst watching all the nearby humpback whales. They were lots of them and they were all pretty eager to flips and slap the water, we didn't get close to impressiveness as the whale in Sydney but was still an excellent afternoon.\nIn the afternoon we weighed anchor (or \"wanker\" as the staff called it, much like they shorten topsail to \"tpsol\" but funnier) and set sail back out to sea. This time the seasickness barely effected me at all, although not everyone was as lucky and there was still a few people that started throwing up again. Mostly though everyone had finally got their \"sea legs\".\nThat night on watch we had a team building exercise and had to put up the storm sail without instructions from Paul (we were allowed to ask 3 questions). I'm not sure how the other teams went, but I think we did pretty poorly. In the end we did get it set, and funnily enough a storm looked to be approaching as we were doing the task and the wind picked up a great deal.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/v1811-day-5/","title":"V18/11 - Day 5"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/v1811-day-7/":{"body":"\nThe weather was slightly improved once we got to the mainland, and were protected by Twofold Bay. We went ashore at Eden and went to visit the Eden Whale Museum, where they keep the skeleton of Old Tom, a killer whale that helped the fishermen lure in other whales and would share in the kill - eating the tongue and leaving the rest for the fishermen.\nSomehow at the Dock waiting to get taken back to the ship I fell in the harbour, causing much amusement for everyone present.\nThat afternoon we had elections for Command Day - the 24 hours in which the youth crew is given full control over the ship. We got everyone to nominate for the positions they wanted, had a silent vote for each position. I was elected watch officer for \"Munchy Watch\". Munchy being the nickname of Captain Damien before he was the captain.\nAfter the elections we had a movie night, and we were shown a black and white video about sailing that was truly incredible footage. Probably we had more respect for what we were seeing as we were on a tall ship at the time, but it truly was some incredible footage and insane weather that they sailed through. At one point the captain (who narrates it) mentions two of the guys on screen that were lost overboard a few days later, and moves on like it was nothing.

At the handover we were given a list of various tasks to complete. From easy ones (don't get sunburnt) to hard one's (our navigation challenge).\nOne of our first tasks was to get a photo taken with all crew members aloft. I am on the topsail yard (middle), second from the left - next to the other Alex.\nOne of the tasks assigned was chef. Amy, Scott and Tammy did an excellent job in the galley and lived up to the expectations Squiz had set for an excellent meal. Even the staff were impressed, and said that often the command day meals are less than amazing.\nOur major task was our navigation challenge. We were given 4 checkpoints that we had to pass through. We had a start/finish line and had a set time frame (I think it was like 14 hours or something) to pass through all the checkpoints and return to the Twofold Bay finish line. We started out in the afternoon heading for the northern-most checkpoint - but the wind was not on our side and we had to keep tacking the ship to avoid sailing into the mainland. As nighttime fell, we realized people needed sleep and so we would have to change our course to something that required less tacking. That and being able to see the lights on the mainland getting closer and closer while you wait for everyone to get ready to tack is a bit concerning.\nMy watch, \"Munchy Watch\", was on first watch and so everyone went down below to bed after we had changed our course for the bottom checkpoint, doing the course in reverse. As watch officer, I was in charge of letting the person on the helm know which bearing to steer and updating our position on the map (below) to ensure we were heading in the right direction (and updating our bearing accordingly if we weren't).\nAs you can see on the map below, we made good progress at first but had to start steering inland (away from the checkpoint) as we got closer as there was a fishing ship in our path. One of our objectives was to keep 1 knot away from all obstacles, and it got pretty hairy with the fishing ship while still trying to maintain an roughly accurate course.\nTowards the end of our watch the wind dropped off completely and was very erratic, making it even more difficult. When we handed over to the next watch, we did a two-watch tack and turned the ship northwards and towards the checkpoint. From there they could continue sailing north to the next two checkpoint before turning back home in the morning to meet our deadline.\nWe were pretty confident that we would be nearing the finish line when we woke up with a job well done. As you can see on the map though the next two watches didn't go to plan. They just continued sailing south basically due to bad weather and wind.\n\nKylie on the bridge for morning watch:\n\nThe red light ensures you don't lose your night vision but can still read the map.\nWe did made it back to the bay the next morning before the deadline... with only 2/4 checkpoints completed.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/v1811-day-8/","title":"V18/11 - Day 8"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/v1811-day1/":{"body":"\nI spent the morning exploring Sydney, but after getting very fed up caring a 12kg backpack around decided to head towards the Gardens Point Navy Base early, which was our point of departure. My first impression of the boat was that&nbsp;it was a lot smaller than I was expecting.\nSince I was a few hours early, I spent some boring time waiting and eventually ran into Lauren who was also on the youth crew. She ended up traveling to Canberra as well, and so was funnily enough the last person I saw as well as the first.\nEventually more and more people arrived and then we were allowed on board. We were shown where to put our bags down below and then came back up on deck for some speeches by the staff and a farewell to the family watching. Two of the youth crew worked for and had been sponsored by Hungry Jacks and so the owner was on board as well - he would be a very rich man.\nIt was quite late by the time we actually set sail, or rather left with the ship's engines. We didn't get far though as we were staying in the bay overnight, and so had a magnificent view of the sunset over the Sydney&nbsp;Harbour as we anchored across from Taronga Zoo.\n\nFor the journey we were split up into 3 watches (Red, White and Blue) and I was in White Watch. We spent the evening getting to know the other members of our watch, and talking to our Watch Leader Paul about our expectations for the journey and what we wanted to get out of it.\nWe had dinner as prepared by the ship chef Squiz and it was pretty amazing. The food for the whole trip was excellent and there was usually a few choices as to what meals were on offer each&nbsp;day.\nThat night we went through the safety for climbing aloft, put on our harnesses and got to climb to the Topgallant Yard while the ship wasn't moving (the highest one - 33m above the water). As I was one of the first to go, we were sitting on the yard for a fair while waiting for the rest of the watch to climb up, which despite the incredible view wasn't the most relaxing position. Despite finding the climb easy, I was not looking forward to doing it while the ship was moving (although by the time I climbed in rough seas it wasn't an issue).\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/v1811-day1/","title":"V18/11 - Day 1"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/v1811-day4/":{"body":"\nWe had the guts shift from 12-4 in the morning. It is difficult to navigate at night when there is no land in sight and lights just come out of nowhere. When you are on watch you have a watch officer (Dion from the staff crew was ours), someone on the helm, lookouts looking for lights/hazards and the rest of the watch is just there in case something needs to happen with the sails. Every hour someone does rounds, checking the ship, recording weather details and going down below to check the generators in the engine room and the fridges.\nDuring our watch we spotted a light in the distance, and so we learned how to tell what kind of ship it was from the lights that they display, and you can also determine which way they are facing to get an idea of their direction. As it got closer we were able to make out more lights and worked out that it was a cargo ship, which we could confirm on the ship's radar. &nbsp; The radar also informed us we were on a collision course, so we altered our course to avoid them. Dion called them up on the ship radio as well, as they decided that they would change course to avoid us as well, moving back into our path.\nIt was incredible just how quick it went from being a single speck of light in the distance to a massive ship in front of us, and a real eye opener to how dangerous it would be if you didn't have watches running and people looking out for dangers.\nAfter we handed over the watch, we went back to bed, waking up in the morning as we were coming in to Jervis Bay. Jervis Bay Territory is a navy training area, and not actually part of NSW. I was not aware that there was another territory besides ACT and NT. The beaches were beautiful with island-white sand that makes that horrible squeaking noise when you walk. We went ashore so that people could \"hug a tree\", which we were informed was the only proven cure for sea sickness besides death.\nRick was in charge of hosting beach activities, and we had a few games of dodge ball and a round of beach flags. There was another Alex on the boat besides myself, referred to as \"Hippy Alex\" who showed some incredible moves in the final round of beach flags to get both flags and take out everyone else in the race.\nOur lesson for today was \"rules of the road\" and Dion went into some more detail about who has right of way and what the various lights mean on boats, and explained why we had a red light on the port side and a green on the starboard.\nIn the afternoon we anchored on the other side of the bay, and the crew declared \"the pool was open\", which meant we were able to use the boat's rope swing and go swimming. Red Watch Leader Guv demonstrated how to do a back-flip off the rope, and I had a failed attempt that was photographed below.\n\nWe were told it was much easier to do a normal back-flip just off a flat platform, so I had a go off the bowsprit and nailed it first go after some more pointers from Guv. The trick we were told is to tilt your head back, like you are looking into the sky and continue looking back, which will cause your body to flip automatically as you go. Mick had a go later on where he looked over his shoulder instead, which resulted in a sort of&nbsp;back-flip&nbsp;with a twist, but didn't really work so well.\nThat night we had a BBQ on the deck for dinner followed by a performance of our 3-way chats. In the morning we were given 2 other crew to team up with and learn various facts about and that night we had to do an introduction of one of the two in the first person, as well as act out charades for their favourite movie. I was with Jake and Kylie, and learned that Jake has broken bones on 8 different occasions and played for the Australian water polo team, and that Kylie wants to chase the endless winter and move to Canada to teach snowboarding. Some people really surprised me in that they gave quite hilarious and entertaining performances when in normal conversations they were completely different people. Other people just had terrible memories.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/v1811-day4/","title":"V18/11 - Day 4"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/v1811-day6/":{"body":"\nWe had a pretty chilled morning sailing on the sea, with a descent speed and good weather. After dinner this awesome looking cloud came.\nTurns out awesome looking clouds like that mean there is a storm coming and we got smashed by some pretty intense weather and had to bring a lot of our sails down.\n{{&lt; vimeo 31721183 &gt;}}\nAfter that taking that video I got to climb to the topgallant yard to tie the gaskets (fold up the square sails), and while up there saw what was either a sun fish or manta ray come up next to the ship. It was huge but you wouldn't have been able to see it on deck. Climbing during the storm was not as scary as I originally thought it would be, and if fact was a lot of fun. Despite being the highest, the topgallant is actually a fairly small sail so Matt and I had no trouble doing the sea furl, but the guys working on the topsail really struggled and took ages to get it tied up.\nDue to the poor weather we changed course and headed in towards Eden so that we could Anchor again, but we were still a fair way out at sea. We (white watch) had morning shift, so we went to bed pretty early and it was quite hard to get to sleep due to the massive rocking of the ship. During our watch we got pounded by waves and the wind had picked up to 40 knots. I got to take the helm for about an hour and it was quite an experience steering the ship during a storm and the intense weather. In the early morning we did a one-watch wear and while I was up at the bow of the ship heaving in the tacking lines it was an intense experience because the waves were breaking over the deck. I had to clip in and got absolutely and repeatedly drenched as the waves smashed over the ship.\nThat was probably one of the highlights of the trip for me, and despite the weather being rough as guts and making it almost impossible to sleep due to the rocking of the ships it was immense fun. I was especially impressed by Kristy who was our staff watch officer for the night, who remained cheery for our entire watch, even though she went off every now and then to spew over the side of the ship.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/v1811-day6/","title":"V18/11 - Day 6"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/v1811-day9/":{"body":"\nAs I mentioned earlier, every morning the staff held a morning brief. One of our command day tasks was to host our own. Rick was our Nanna, Ash gave the long winded Nav talk, and I was Salty Seadog with the help of my assistant Emma.\n\nTo show of our newly learned knot-tying skills - one task was to build a Hammock that could support the entire youth crew:\n\nWhen our 24 hours were up, the crew assessed how we had met each task. They deemed all tasks completed - even navigation was awarded since the wind dropped and made it pretty much impossible.\nWe had a debrief of command day, and went ashore with our watch leaders to discuss whether we had met all the goals we had set ourselves at the start of the journey.\nIt was Bec's 21st the day after we berthed, so we decided to throw her an early party so she could say she had a birthday party on a multimillion dollar yacht. Emma bought decorations from the IGA while we were ashore.\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/v1811-day9/","title":"V18/11 - Day 9"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/v1811-final-day/":{"body":"\nIn the morning we did some harbour furls (neatly rolled up the square sails), then briefly headed out to sea so that we could come back again for all the family members on shore. We stayed up on the yards for the berthing, and fired cannon blasts as is tradition. The tradition being that by having everyone up on the yards, there is nobody to reload the cannons - and since they have already been fired the ship poses no threat.\nThe Mayor of Eden was there to great us, and we were all given certificates and posed for another group photo (above).\nThat afternoon was the Eden Whale Festival, which was not as exciting as I was expecting to be but gave something to do to pass the time until my bus ride home the next morning.\nAs they say, it really was an experience of a lifetime and I had a phenomenal time. I had high expectations going in but I did not to expect it to be as rewarding or enjoyable as it was. The staff were infectiously happy and I got to see a whole new part of Australia and gain a small appreciation for life on the sea. I highly recommend that everyone who has an opportunity to apply do so.\nThe captain put up a daily log as well, and I found a blog post by another youth crew, Jess.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2011/v1811-final-day/","title":"V18/11 - Final Day"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2012/":{"body":"","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2012/","title":"2012"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2012/back-of-the-uni-loop/":{"body":"\n\nSo a while a go I discovered a really nice route to go for a bike ride, by looking at Strava segments. The segment had a ridiculous amount of people riding it compared to all the other ones, and it is quite close to where we live.\nAfter riding it, the reason why it was so popular became pretty clear. It has incredible views looking out over a valley and there are various farm animals along the way. I think some of the animals may belong to USQ, ant they might have them for agricultural courses. Rachael has been coming along for rides as well, to get her animal fix by petting the horses through the fence.\n\nThe other day there were goats on the road, which were more than willing to approach when Rachael offered grass. Once the grass stopped being offered it didn't like being patted without the food incentive, it decided to ram Rachael. She may disagree, but it was quite hilarious to watch.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2012/back-of-the-uni-loop/","title":"Back of the Uni Loop"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2012/byron-bay/":{"body":"\nSo after finishing up my rotation in Brisbane, Rachael and I had a few days free to do some travel before moving up to Toowoomba.\n\nThe drive down south almost started off slow, with a major accident on the highway, but we managed to use the traffic layer on google maps to take a massive detour that meant we didn't have to wait for hours for it to clear and made it down to the NSW border without wasting too much time. It was our first time driving in NSW and they have a massive amount of speed cameras. They also have wildlife bridges, which I had heard about but didn't know that they had them in Australia.\n\nWe stopped at a really nice beach that Tom and I had been to earlier in the year looking for a surf, but didn't actually get out and explore then (since there was no waves). So Rachael and I stopped by for a better look, the water was an incredibly clear blue.\nWe spent the first night camping at Byron Bay and froze our butts off. We didn't get a chance to check much out the afternoon before because it was hard to get parks, so we went up in the early morning to the lighthouse and most easterly point of the Australian mainland. Since I want to go to the cape at some stage anyway, it would be pretty cool to tick off the other 2 points one day as well.\n\n\nThere were tonnes of whales and dolphins in the water, it was a bit hard to see from up at the lookout but you could see them shooting water up every now and then. There were some people out on kayaks that were really close to a whale and group of dolphins that would have had an incredible view.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2012/byron-bay/","title":"Byron Bay"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2012/coffs-harbour/":{"body":"\nAfter Byron, we quickly stopped by Lennox Heads for a squiz, where we also good to see some cool wildlife. There was a group of sea birds swooping an area where you could see fish jumping. There must have been dolphins or something scaring the fish and the birds were taking advantage of it.\nFrom there we pretty much headed straight to our final destination, Coffs Harbour. Rachael really wanted to check it out since she had some work friends that had grown up there that must have given it rave reviews. The town reminded me a bit of Eden and also Yeppoon.\n\nWe stopped at the Big Banana for a touristy photo, then headed to the marina. They have joined the marina up to Mutton bird Island, which is a nesting ground for Mutton birds. They had rat traps everywhere, which I am assuming only became a problem once they joined it up to the mainland - not sure how smart that was even though it was good for us to be able to walk out. There wasn't many birds there but it was a nice walk.\n\nAfter freezing the night before we looked around for a cheap room, but eventually decided to camp again after looking at prices. Camping was pretty expensive as it was considering it's $30 for a bit of grass for the night. Luckily it was nowhere near as cold that night. We had planned to stay for 2 nights, but since we had seen most things the day before and the weather didn't look like it was going to improve we pretty much just drove back.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2012/coffs-harbour/","title":"Coffs Harbour"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2012/dave-kylies-wedding/":{"body":"\nWhen you do a Google search for \"Dave and Kylie\" the top link is their website Dave and Kylie are getting married, so you know it must be an important event.\nI haven't really been to a wedding before (not since I was like 10 anyway) and so I was kind of excited for the experience. Kylie works with Rachael at the tissue bank, and Dave is an electrical engineer so you know he must be a top bloke.\nThe wedding was very lovely, in a non-denominational chapel which didn't have all the Jesus statues being tortured and whatnot. The couple seemed a combination of exceedingly happy and nervous throughout. I was surprised actually at how fast the time went.\n\nThe reception was at the Summit Restaurant at Mt Coot-ha and the weather was probably the best that it has been when I've been up there so there was incredible views.\nThe food was quite good, the staff made sure our wine was always topped to the brim (not sure this is responsible service of alcohol but it was certainly good) and the entertainment was excellent. It was a lone guy with a memory man and he did some incredible covers that were probably better than some like-a-version performances.\nThey also had a photo-booth which was an awesome idea. It printed one for you to keep and one to go in a scrapbook.\n\nIt was an incredibly fun and memorable day for Rachael and I, hopefully it was even better for the bride and groom.

This year I have been a bit slack with listening to new music, so the challenge was filling the ten slots with songs I felt deserved it, whilst not voting for the same artist more than once.\nI'm sure when I see the final list there will be plenty of songs that may have deserved my vote that I didn't consider, but in any case I am happy with the following ten for now, so here they are.\nGotye - Somebody That I Used To Know\nThis is clearly going to take out the number 1 spot. I remember when Sarah used to tell me to turn that \"weird shit\" off when I used to play Like Drawing Blood. Good on him for making a pop hit.\nThe Beards - You Should Consider Having Sex With a Bearded Man\nI am a sucker for musically awesome novelty bands.\nBusby Marou â Underlying Message\nThey were probably even more impressive then Birds of Tokyo when I saw them at the Western. Good to see a local band making it relatively big.\nTim Minchin - Pope Song\nI remember having an argument with someone at work (when I worked at K-mart) about swearing and how it is wrong because it says so in the bible. This song perfectly sums up my thoughts on the matter. I wasn't expecting this to chart, but considering none of Tim Minchin's new songs were listed in the song list I guess not even some of the less controversial one's will feature either, which is a shame.\nBluejuice - Act Your Age\nI have always liked their recordings, but I was a bit dissapointed in Bluejuice when I saw the at Big Day Out a few years ago. At the Oxy Street party last week they changed my mind though, and this song went off live.\nNero - Me &amp; You\nI don't know why I like this song, but I do.\nBoy &amp; Bear - Feeding Line\nThe Black Keys - Lonely Boy\nBall Park Music - It's Nice To Be Alive\nIntermashional First Class - All I Know {Ft.

The other three boys have been really into the mountain biking of late and have done a couple of adventure races.\nBully let me use his spare bike and we embarked on a leisurely 20km ride through the forest. As the start our expectation of a trail was very different to the makers of our map, and so we repeatedly rode past the turn off for the first check point. However, once we realised that a barely visible goat track was represented as a trail on the map we were fine.\nConsidering my lack of exercise in recent months, I found the whole thing quite easy, although I was clearly slowing down the other guys towards the end. We still ended up beating two other guys that kept over-taking us but then somehow getting lost and getting to each checkpoint after us.\nOverall it was a pretty fun day, and we came and gave it a try. None of us really enjoyed it enough to want to join the club, as the race itself wasn't any more fun then it would be to go for a ride in the area and find your own tracks. The other 2 times I have been with the boys to Daisy Hill and Bunya and just rode the trails (for free) were equally as fun and more leisurely.\nPhotos and results for the event are here.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2012/mountain-bike-orienteering/","title":"Mountain Bike Orienteering"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2012/partial-solar-eclipse/":{"body":"\n\nI've always thought it would be cool to see a solar eclipse.

And since we are going to Fiji early next year, and there is no airport in Toowoomba, it wasn't worth trying to get time off work to drive up, and Rachael definitely couldn't.\nIn any case it was still semi exciting to see the partial one from down here in Toowoomba. Attempts to photograph it with my camera failed, but I eventually worked out you could see the eclipse in the halo of the photos from my phone camera.\nSince it was only partial, it didn't get very dark here. It did dim slightly and the sky had a weird tinge to it like it looked like a few weeks ago when there were bush fires and lots of smoke in the air. There was no temperature drops or birds going quite.\n\nI also tried out using the binoculars in reverse, which was a pretty good way to check how much was covered but you still couldn't see much.\nWas a cool experience, a bit bummed I didn't get to experience the totality though.

Not too much has changed since last time I went there. They do have Emperor Penguins now, which were fun to watch.\nThere is also now a Dinosaur Island, which I don't see the relevance of in a water park but they did have some cool fossils. The main display had animatronic dinosaurs similar to Jurassic Park, but I was pleased to see there inside display had more correct displays where they were all covered in feathers and weird looking.\nIn case you have no idea what I am on about, this is what they now think a Velociraptor would have looked like.\nThe funniest part of the day was when we went to the Ray Pool, where you can pat the sting rays. Rachael put her hand in to pat them without rolling up her jumper, so had a wet jumper arm for the rest of the morning. The sting rays themselves felt cool, really slippery kind of like moss.\nThe main show is no longer a water-ski show but jet-ski. They had some world-class guys doing some truly incredible tricks, such as doing about 8 back flips in a row from their own wake.\nOne thing that did make me sad though is that the only roller coaster they have was closed for maintenance.

When you live somewhere, people never seem to visit the places nearby because it will always be there and there is no pressure resulting from a lack of time in the area. On my last weekend before leaving, Jan, one of my roommates from Switzerland, just happened to be flying into Australia before starting his new graduate rotation for ABB in Melbourne.\nTo locals, Rocky is thought of as a hole, and it doesn't seem to get too much tourism attention either, so I doubt Jan would have chosen it as a place to visit if I wasn't offering a local tour guide experience. Since pretty much the only people who would read this are from Rocky, it might give you a chance to see some of the cool places nearby that most people haven't bothered visiting in the 20 or so years they have lived there.\nJan flew in Friday and chilled at the gardens before I picked him up after work. We went to my cousin's 18th and Jan got to experience an Aussie BBQ.\nAustralia Day\nFor Australia Day we went to my friend's backyard Hottest 100 party, and considering it was stinking hot, it wouldn't have been complete without a slip-and-slide.\n\nWhen the water wasn't running the tarp heated up to an crazy temperature, but despite Adrian's attempt it wasn't quite hot enough to cook an egg on it.\nJan made a comment to me about how special the day is where we can be proud of our country. Considering it's past, there is no equivalent day for Germans to just celebrate being German.\nIn the afternoon we headed down to Yeppoon for the beach party, where Tripod were playing. I have wanted to see Tripod play for a long time and I wasn't let down, they played an excellent gig. Despite the fact that most of the audience were toddlers, they didn't tone down the adult content, just warned them all that they weren't the wiggles. The fireworks were started prematurely and it was pretty spectacular listening to them improvise about the person who probably just blew up their hand with fireworks in the background.\nKoorana Crocodile Farm\nThe next day Johan from work joined us and we did a tour of the crocodile farm. It had been a long time since I had been to Koorana, and they have got some much bigger crocs since when I went as a kid.\n\nWaterpark Creek\nAfter the croc farm we went to Ferns Hideaway to use the canoes, and paddle up Waterpark Creek.\n\n\nAfterwards, Jan even got to get up close and personal with some wallabies who were near the camping ground.\n\nMt. Jim Crow\nJan went to see the Capricorn Caves. Having been twice I didn't bother paying to go again, and had a quick look at the nearby Etna caves. There wasn't much to see without a guide, as the walking track there was a pretty short path that didn't go anywhere in particular.\nWe took the back way to the beach, and went for a hike up Mt. Jim Crow along the way.\n\n\nWe got some pineapple from a seller on the side of the road, something that Jan said you don't see in Germany. Apparently it was the freshest he had tasted, but I have had better.\nThe weather went to crap a bit after that, as can be seen in the clouds in the picture above. The next morning we went up to Farnborough for a surf, where I snapped my leg rope as the waves were just big dumpers. On the plus side, we went the back way so the Suzy got one last strap going off road before I headed off to Brisbane and Jan back to Melbourne.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2012/sightseeing-at-home/","title":"Sightseeing at Home"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2012/tangalooma-island-resort/":{"body":"\nMum &amp; Dad came down for the Easter long weekend, and on the Saturday we went on a day trip to Moreton Island.\nThe ferry over was kind of interesting, we went down the Brisbane river and so went past the port where they load all the shipping containers as well as all the all refineries. There was a crazy amount of jellyfish in the water at the mouth of the river as well.\nWhen we got to the resort we were pretty disappointed, since the package had advertised free use of the resort sport facilities. Turns out this does not include snorkeling gear as mum though, and what it did include has to be booked. As it was a public holiday all the things we wanted to use had already been booked out for the day.\nWe went for a walks up the wrecks where people snorkel. It would have been a lovely area to snorkel on any other day probably, but the area was teeming with boats. There were boats driving around where people were in snorkeling and it was pretty dangerous in general.\n\nPart of our package included a 4x4 sand-boarding package which turned out to be a lot of fun. Doing the 4x4 tracks in a bus was a different experience as the whole bus rocks when it gets hung up on the sand. The dunes themselves were closed off to cars, but the resort had a special format so we can drive up to the dune face. We saw some people walk over from where the public track ended and it was a descent hike.\nTo get to the top of the dune you had to climb up (with your board) which was no mean feat. Combined with the walk to the dune it would hardly be worth your while. Mum and Rachael only could manage one go, while dad and I got in 2 before we had to leave. I would braked the hike back to the top for one more go if we had time.\n\nThe actual boarding itself was pretty awesome, you get to a pretty descent speed. The bumps at the bottom really wind you but other than that it was sort of like snow tobogganing (except face first). Some people stacked it and got a massive face full of sand.\n\nIn the afternoon we went in for a swim at the beach in front of the resort. There was tonnes of bait fish hanging around the whole time. At one point a dolphin swam past, and as the first thing we saw was a dark shape in the water about 1.5m long with a fin, Rachael shat her pants and ran out of the water. I was wary at first but realised pretty early that it was a dolphin and so stopped turning around to run and tried to get closer. I think Rachael's screaming scared her off though.\nWe later found out that the dolphin was called Betty and is a local to the resort. She is quite old and they described her as \"retired\" as she only hangs out at the resort and waits for a feed, she no longer hunts in the wild.\n\nThe dolphin feeding was really magic. The dolphins came right up to the shore after sunset and were quite playful. We got to feed them a small bait fish each. Rachael dropped her fish when the dolphin opened it's mouth and she saw that they have teeth.\nThere was a lot of Asian tourists there and one thing that detracted was the experience was their refusal to obey instructions. We were told at the start that it was illegal to touch the dolphins (you pass the fish to them) and the reason is so they don't catch any human diseases from us. They had resort staff their to translate for them, and it was made repeatedly clear you would be asked to leave the resort if you tried to touch them. Despite this, almost every single one of the Asian tourists attempted to pat them. None of them got kicked out but the staff had to physically hold their hands and keep pulling them back so they didn't do it. A couple got through and touched it but didn't really get in trouble. One guy attempted it repeatedly.\nThe day started out kind of annoying, but ultimately it turned out to be a great experience and I highly recommend both the sand-boarding and dolphin feeding for a day trip.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2012/tangalooma-island-resort/","title":"Tangalooma Island Resort"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2012/tcof-festival/":{"body":"\nLast weekend was the start of the Toowoomba Carnival of Flowers. We bought 3-day tickets to the Flower, Food and Wine Festival so we could check out all the bands.\n\n\nFriday night was our first glimpse of the festival. It was sort of like a show with various art and flower displays, but nothing overly exciting. Other than that there was stalls selling garden stuff, and food stalls. One thing that was a very good set up was the wine stalls though. You could go around and taste the wine at each stall, and then buy a bottle if you wanted to drink while you watched the bands.\n\nThe first night the bands were Owl Eyes and Bluejuice. Owl Eyes sounded great, but I didn't particularly get into any of their originals. Bluejuice were really good, but not as lively as when I saw them in Rocky.\nSecond night Ross Wilson (Daddy Cool) played, which was pretty cool to see the Eagle Rock live. I think Rachael was disappointed that everyone didn't drop their pants. Mental as Anything also played, but we left before they finished their set.\n\nOn Sunday Lior played. Was a pretty great set, and he finished with 2 new songs that he had never played live before. I thought one new song (Alas) was particularly good, so I am excited for his new album. In the afternoon James Reyne (Australian Crawl) played, and was pretty good. The final act was an ABBA tribute, Bjorn Again. They didn't sound that great for the opening song but ended up sounding really good.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2012/tcof-festival/","title":"TCOF Flower Food and Wine Festival"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2012/tcof-parade/":{"body":"On the Saturday morning there was a parade.

It was a very strange venue, basically a pub where they had blocked off the front room. Was very cramped but was a pretty good atmosphere.\nThe first support, Kim Churchill was excellent. Rachael likened him to a cross between Xavier Rudd and Ash Grunwald which I agree is a fairly accurate comparison. He had an incredibly full sound for a single person. The support of them, The Snowdroppers, weren't as good. They were okay but I didn't really get into them and Rachael found the singer creepy. He did have weird eyes, they were shiny like a cats.\nI should mention that the turn out was very beard-centric. Most the guys had beards, and the girls had woollen beard or had drawn on beards with a texta. They did their own sound check, and instead testing the mics with the traditional \"One Two\" they tested them with \"Beards\". They were pretty hilarious just in general. They introduces the first song, saying that it was about beards. And likewise that the second song was in the key of B.... for Beards. and so on. Other stage presence included awarding trophies for best and worst beard.\nThe songs were all pretty good considering their limited subject material it is impressive the amount of quality songs they have written about beards. I was particularly impressed with their musical talent, the singer broke out into a couple of awesome saxophone solos when he wasn't rocking the kee-tar.\nIt was an excellent concert, it was way better than I expecting. At the moment I don't have a beard so much as haven't been bothered to shave for a week.

In addition to the road being lined with beautiful tall trees for most of the way, the Hottest 100 of the past 20 years was playing on the radio, making for a pretty good drive.\nThe camping grounds were pretty good, I think they must be fairly popular during summer. We went on the 2km walk to a lookout. It was a fairly nice walk, but not a lot of views along the way, so when we got to the end and saw the view from the lookout we were blown away. According to the signs it's called \"The Valley of Diamonds\", and was a much more spectacular view then we were expecting.\n\nHeading back the other way,we went a different track and this one actually followed along the creek, so there was several water falls and cool rocky areas. It reminded me a little bit of Stoney Creek in places. I only had my phone so didn't take too many photos.\n\nWe will definitely be keen to come back in summer, after a bit of rain it would be a really cool swimming area.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2013/crows-nest-national-park/","title":"Crows Nest National Park"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2013/fiji-nadi/":{"body":"\nOn the flight over to Fiji, we flew over some other islands, which were probably New Caledonia. Those islands, and the reefs of Fiji itself looked awesome from the plane. As we are landing I also noticed a pretty cool temple, which a quick Google reveals it is called the Sri Siva Subramaniya temple. We later saw it on the bus/in and out of Nadi but didn't visit it for a close look.\nNadi, pronounced Nandi with a silent 'n' which the Fijian's seem to enjoy (we later ordered a dish called Kokoda which was pronounced 'Kakonda', was the town/city where we landed. Walking in the airport we were greeted by some guys on the ukelele and customs officials in Hawaiian shirts. They love their Hawaiian shirts in Fiji, but Rachael tells me they are more stylish then the one's worn in Australia.\nWe got a taxi to the resort, which was a crappy old car painted yellow like a New York taxi and the engine sounded terrible. Our driver stalled it 3 times in a row at one stage when we had to stop for traffic at the top of a slight hill.\nMy first impressions driving in was that it was a bit of a cross between Vietnam and Australia. A lot more unkempt and run-down then Australia (more like Vietnam) but fairly spacious and more ordered, with road signs that seemed to be mostly adhered to.\n\nWe were to spend the first night at Nadi Bay Hotel Resort, before heading to Pacific Harbour, and were in a dorm with a nice guy from Nottingham. Interestingly there was graves next to our dorm, which were probably old resort staff. Apparently it's okay to be buried in your own backyard in Fiji, as we saw graves at houses fairly often.\nWe went for a walk to look around and saw a 3 car pileup with one car lodging itself underneath the rear end of a Hilux. We didn't bother getting a taxi into town, and thought it was a fair walk to the beach (it wasn't) so just went back to the hotel and had dinner. Food prices in Fiji are about the same as in Oz, except in Fijian dollars and so relative to our currency meals were about half price.\nThe next day we waited for the Coral Sun bus to Pacific Harbour, and had our first experience with 'Fiji Time' as it was about 20mins late, despite saying on the booking we had to wait 15mins early. The booking was a bit of a failure in general as when we called up to double check where we were getting picked up they didn't have a record of our booking even though we could sent a confirmation email which we had printed out.\n\nWhen we came back from Pacific Harbour at the end of the trip, I had a chance to download offline maps of Nadi on my phone and we realised the beach wasn't far at all. Upon going for a walk to check it out, we probably could have done without as it was covered in rubbish and not that appealing. We did have lunch at a cool Japanese restaurant the day before we left though, which was worth the very short walk.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2013/fiji-nadi/","title":"Fiji - Nadi"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2013/fiji-pacific-harbour/":{"body":"\n\nOn Saturday we got the bus to the Uprising Beach Resort in Pacific Harbour, where we stayed for 7 nights. We had lunch at the restaurant while we waited for check-in time and I had fish and chips (the fish was awesome) and Rachael had Kokoda (photo right) which was fish in a coconut shell with Cassava chips (sort of a cross between potato and cooking banana).\n\nOur beachfront bure (pronounced like Boo-Ray) was quite awesome. Had really high ceilings and good air flow so was pretty cool (didn't have air-con) and had a little verandah where you could look out at the beach. We were the closest to the pool and restaurant as well so we didn't have to walk far for dinner each night.\n\nI thought one of the coolest things was our outdoor shower. There were plants in there as well and it was cool having a shower in nature, especially at night time you could look up and see the stars. Only negative to it I could think of was it would be cold in winter being outdoors. I thought of a another negative when I had a shower later in the week during a massive thunderstorm and there was lightning around.\nOn Sunday we went in to the Arts Village in Pacific Harbour (about 10mins walk) to look around. There was some cool buildings and bridges, it was very touristy as there was a theatre area where they have native Fijian ceremony displays.\n\nWe had lunch there and got fish burgers, but they weren't particularly nice, as the fish wasn't as fresh as the rest of the fish we ate in Fiji. We were told there would be a bon fire at the resort that night, but it rained so it was cancelled. Rachael was super excited for this bon fire each night but it would always rain in the afternoon and the wood would get wet. Finally on our last night it was dry, but at about 9:30 there was no signs of anything happening so we went back to the bure and went to bed, only to find it burned on the beach the next morning. Rachael was pretty annoyed. They must have lit it fairly late though.\nMonday we went into Suva and then I got sick that afternoon. Tuesday we didn't get up to much, as I was still feeling a bit average, although we did go for a kayak in the afternoon just off the beach.\nWednesday we went for a snorkel in the ocean out the front of our resort, it was just a short boat ride and I think it was this reef. The weather Tuesday had been brilliant, but it was overcast and rainy Wednesday morning when we went for the snorkel, which was a bit of a bummer as it made it harder to see. The coral was still super bright though, with a fair few baby fish swimming around. Rachael was worried about sharks eating us, but we didn't even see baby sharks let alone the big \"friendly\" sharks of Fiji. You can go shark feeding in Fiji without a cage, because apparently all the sharks in Fiji are \"friendly sharks\" even though they are Bull and Tiger sharks that you feed.\nRachael had the fish of the day Tuesday night and it tasted amazing, and for lunch on Wednesday I tried some freshly caught Walu fish which was equally amazing. Frozen stuff from the supermarket really doesn't compare to freshly caught fish.\nThursday we had planned to do a village visit and drink some Kava, but there wasn't enough people so we booked white water rafting for Friday instead as that was the only tour that seemed good for the price. Thursday we didn't get up to much, although we did play Volleyball with the locals and some of the resort staff in the afternoon. It was pretty fun until a storm started with really close lightning, and the beach volleyball court turned into a water polo court. The thunder during the storm was really impressive, it sounded different to back home. I think it was reverberating between Beqa Island and the main land because it was really drawn out.\nFor lunch on Thursday we went for a walk up the road to a local looking restaurant we had seen on the bus to Suva. I got the duck curry special which was super spicy and full of bones but tasted great. It reminded of the chicken curry that Jayantha (a guy from work from Sri Lanka) made for us, which tasted incredible but was difficult to eat on account of all the random bones and whole pieces of herbs and the abundance of chilli powder. Despite tasting much better, I prefer the convenience of a normal Indian curry sans bones.\nAfter the rafting on Friday, I got sick again. But this time Rachael got sick as well, so after a terrible nights sleep we were more than happy to check out Saturday morning and get the bus back to Nandi and head home.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2013/fiji-pacific-harbour/","title":"Fiji - Pacific Harbour"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2013/fiji-rafting-upper-navua-river/":{"body":"\nEasily the highlight of the trip was white-water rafting down the \"Grand Canyon of Fiji\". That is what the posters called it, but two American's we met who had been there said it didn't even compare. It was still magnificent though.\nWe got picked up from the hotel in a 4x4 again and taken to a nearby resort, The Pearl, same as we did for snorkelling. It's kind of dodgy really, both cars were full of junk in the back and the seat belts in the back seat were stuck under the seat so you couldn't use them. It was only a short drive so didn't really matter but was expecting more for the money we paid.\n\nFrom there we got a bus and after a drive on the highway, headed off-road on some beautiful tracks into the rainforest. After a briefing about entering a national park and how we couldn't leave anything behind (including poo - they told us they had special bags if we needed) and putting on our life jackets, we went for a short hike to the rafts. The really annoying thing about not leaving anything behind while in the conservation area, was at the end of the day as we were driving back, the staff had no problem throwing their rubbish out the window of the car (we saw them special times) once they were out of the conservation area.\n\nThe actual rapids were only a class 2-3 and weren't as fun as the one's I did in Switzerland, but the scenery was stunning. Some of the canyon walls even had coral in them, from long ago when it was all under water.\n\n\n\n\nThe conservation area ended with a massive waterfall, which we got to stop and stand under. The water was way more powerful than I was expecting and super cold. As we were getting close to the village where we were to hop out, there was a spot where two rivers converged, and like in Switzerland you could clearly see the two colours and determine which water come from which stream.\n\nOur rafting finished at the Wainadiro village, where there was the skinniest dog I had ever seen. It looked like it was about to fall over from starvation, it was pretty sad. From there we had another off-road drive back, but this time the bus got bogged when it tried to overtake the truck with the rafting gear in it. So we had a little more adventure at the end of the day waiting for them to get out the snatch strap and pull it out. Our shoes were absolutely soaked by the end of the day, and Rachael had old lady feet. Since it's constantly raining in Fiji, all our clothes were still wet when had to pack them for the plane, so our luggage was pretty smelly.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2013/fiji-rafting-upper-navua-river/","title":"Fiji - Rafting Upper Navua River"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2013/fiji-suva/":{"body":"\nWe got a bus into Suva on Monday morning to check out the big city. The bus in was an adventure, we got a local bus, which was only $3.30 FJD to Suva from Uprising. The bus stopped for anyone on the way that waved it down, even in narrow sections of the highway at the top of hills, or in the middle of a turn off so that it was blocking traffic from turning.\nAt one point we had to stop for petrol, so the bus pulled into a service station and we waited while the driver filled it up. We then had another wait at the main bus station while someone got on and counted the number of tickets sold. All up it took us over 2 hours to get to Suva, even though the return trip on the way back took about 1hour - since we paid $5 for the express bus.\n\nSuva itself was a bit of a let down. First up we went to the museum, with various people stopping us on the way asking us where we were from and I assume trying to sell us things. The museum itself was pretty good. They had some rafts that were used to go between the island back in the day - impressive what can be made with just wood and vines. The picture to the right was pretty cool, one tribe used shark tooth swords and puffer fish helmets in combat.\nOne thing that was depressing was the conversion of all the locals from their local religion to Christianity. There old religion sounded much better to me, and it's sad how the Europeans just came in and converted everyone. Hinduism and Islam are also popular there though, so at least there is some diversity.\nThe actual town itself reminded me a bit of Vietnam, very dirty and busy streets with lots of small shops. The prices weren't as impressive as Vietnam though, things were only slightly cheaper than Australia once you calculated for the currency difference. One thing that Rachael thought was pretty cool was the markets, again they reminded me of the markets we went to in Vietnam.\nAfter a few hours we got tired of walking around, so headed back to Pacific Harbour on the express bus, they bus even had a movie playing.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2013/fiji-suva/","title":"Fiji - Suva"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2013/friday-night-fever/":{"body":"\nWe had the work social club party at the cube on Friday night, with a 70s theme.

So after lots of convincing, I convinced Rachael that we should go along.

It was fairly similar to Mt. Jim Crow terrain. Rachael didn't seem that keen to go back up again any time soon, but I think I will head up again when there is better visibility, would be better than my normal jog around the park.

It was so busy you couldn't even make your way around to the food and wine stands, as to get any where you needed to squish your way through the crowd at a snail's pace to go anywhere. All the bands were quite good though, especially The Whitlams. The Sunday night was a bit less crowded and dad and I got to sample some wines. We found an awesome Strawberry wine, and talked to a guy that is working on a Lichee Cider.\n\nOn the Sunday night Dragon played, but with a different lead singer it was basically like watching a cover band. The Commitments were surprisingly good, despite not knowing many of their songs they were a super punch big band and really enjoyable.\nThe council gardens looked just as good as last year, but despite different patterns were mostly the same.

Looking at the activity log for my account, the first bit of data is from Sep 4th 2007, which is just shy of 7 years ago.\nSo I thought I would try and delete my history, but Facebook doesn't have an option for that and the scripts available that do do it aren't working at the moment. Not that this means Facebook actually deletes it anyway, but it would have been a good start.\nIn any case, before I attempted to delete everything I first backed everything up, and used Wolfram Alpha's Personal Analytics for Facebook to make some cool graphs. I had used it ages ago but I thought it might be good to save them here prior to removing most of the data source.\nBy far the coolest graph is the friend relationships one. From mine you can see a couple of distinct groups of people that don't know each other, and then the uni and high school groups all intermingled, as you would expect since everyone is from Rockhampton. Then there is some joins between work friends at Ergon and uni friends, which also makes sense.\n\nThen looking at the breakup by demographics is pretty interesting also.

The drive up was pretty good, we stopped at Acland (a ghost town) on the way, and closer to the mountains we saw an echidna on the side of the road.\nWe had lunch at the main \"The Bunyas\" restaurant which was good, but not great. There was tonnes of awesome rainforest walks from here, which is where the main campsite is. Since it was so busy, we booked the Burtons Well Camping Area which is a bit more out of the way, and turned out to be much nicer. Each campsite had it's own fireplace and a big heap of firewood (seemed to be woodwork offcuts) was provided.\nNear the campsite there was a couple of other walks, a short one up a mountain which had excellent views at sunset. There was a longer one we did in the morning which wasn't as exciting, although we didn't do the whole track.\nIt was a very nice area, and there was rock wallabies everywhere. We will definitely come up here to camp again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/bunya-mountains/","title":"Bunya Mountains"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/goomburra-state-forest/":{"body":"\nOn Sunday we went for a drive to Goomburra State Forest, which is part of the Main Range National Park. There was a tonne of people camping there because of the long weekend.\nThere is a road right up to the top, although we had to do a creek crossing in Rachael's Yaris. From Mt Castle lookout you are supposed to be able to see Brisbane, but it was a pretty hazy day so we couldn't even see Mt Cootha. We also did the walk to Araucaria Falls.\nIt's part of the same world heritage area as Lamington National Park.

We stayed at Sommerville Valley Tourist Park which is on Storm King Dam. They had kayak's you could take out and we are keen to go back in Summer when the water is less freezing.\nOn the way we did the fruit run tourist drive and had a look at some of the wineries. Since we were taking it in turns driving we couldn't actually do any wine tasting, but we have been meaning to do a bus tour for a while now, so definitely keen to do it again coming into spring.\nThat afternoon we went to Girraween National Park, which was by far the highlight for me. We walked up to the Pyramids, which were like an Uluru style rock mountain. Rachael didn't come up all the way to the top with me, because the track was super steep and difficult, but the view from the top was phenomenal.\nAnother cool sight was the Ballandean Pyramid, which was nearby The Pyramids, but was an actual pyramid that was on a wine property. You could see it from the road, but couldn't get too close.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat night we went to Anna's Restaurant, and had the buffet. The main meals were delicious. The desert's looked awesome, but didn't taste as good as they looked.\n\n\n\nThe next day, we back-tracked through Girraween and across the border to Tenterfield which had huge Autumn trees as you drove in and looked awesome. We then drove back up through to get to the NSW side of the national park and check out Bald Rock. In NSW you have to pay $7 to park in the national park which is a bit lame. We didn't climb all the way up to the top, but it had similar views to the Pyramids and was also pretty cool.\n\n\n\nFrom here we drove along the border through back roads to Killarney, which is an amazing area. Everything is incredibly green. I showed Rachael a place I had been to for work called Acacia Plateau, which has crazy picturesque rolling green hills. Queen Mary Falls was our last stop, and pretty good, although nothing compared to some of the waterfalls we saw the other week at Lamington Park.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/granite-belt/","title":"Granite Belt"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/hakuba/":{"body":"\nSo we were finally off to Hakuba to enjoy the snow that had caused so much dramas. We got an early-ish train from Shinjuku but then had to wait for 2 hours at Shinanoomachi Station for the local train to Hakuba. When we did get to Hakuba we couldn't find any taxi's but luckily the hotel was happy to come and pick us all up when we called them. The Hakuba High Mount Hotel where we stayed was awesome like that, they had a free shuttle down and back to the Sakka lift every day as well (only a few minute drive).\nBy coincidence our first night in Hakuba, and my birthday, was Jackson and Bully's last night in town from their ski trip. So we met at the local pub, \"The Pub\" for drinks. Was a super fun night and great catching up with them. The rest of the family left reasonable early but Rachael and I stayed until quite late and then walked back up the hill in the snow. Was an excellent finish to my birthday but meant that I was super tired the next day.\nOur first day on the slopes was at happo-one as this is where everyone had their lessons. I didn't do lessons, but stuck close to the green runs they were learning on to see how they were going. It wasn't a particularly good day as I was tired and trying to keep Mum and Sarah motivated as they weren't particularly enjoying themselves. Rachael and dad loved it from the start.\nThe second day I took Rachael and Dad up the mountain on a green run and Rachael has a bit of a tantrum when she got stuck in powder as there had been a huge snowfall that night. I tried doing a fun jump I had found the day but just ended up in waist deep powder and had to dig myself out, so we pretty much had to keep to the groomed runs. Mum and Sarah came down about lunch time and had another go but still didn't enjoy themselves as they hadn't quite got the hang of it.\nThird day was super windy so some lifts were closed but we got the gondola up and did a higher green run. Rachael didn't like being close to the cliff, so had another freak out and lost confidence, which was a shame because she had improved heaps until then.\nHappo-One had a fire festival that night, which we went to get free hot sake (which wasn't actually hot) and see some fireworks. Unfortunately it was -11 degrees and windy so wasn't as enjoyable as we had anticipated as we were all freezing. We got to see the bonfire display and some previous olympic skiers come down the mountain, as well as some synchronised skiing which looked awesome. We got too cold and left before the fireworks though.\nWe were meant to have a day off to go see the snow monkeys, but yet again too much snow meant that we were trapped in Hakuba as all the roads and trains were closed, and so the tour had been cancelled. This time round things weren't as bad as we were able to move the skiing forward a day and reschedule. Having accommodation helped as well.\nOn the last two days we went to Iwatake and the runs were much more fun and easy for mum and Sarah to have another try. This time Sarah got the hang of it and then mostly enjoyed the last two days, although mum still didn't like skiing. Iwatake has lots more jumps and tree runs for me on the side of the green runs, so I enjoyed it way more than the first 3 days. The fact that everyone had improved and could keep up probably helped as well. The last day was particularly awesome,\nas I ditched everyone else for a while and had a few runs smashing down from the top of the gondola to the bottom of the mountain.\nBully was confident that we would find Hakuba the best snow of anywhere, and I think it was a solid call. I still think Les Diablerets was slightly better, but it was definitely up there. There were plenty of other resorts we didn't try so I would definitely go back. We had heard good things about Cortina but it was a long bus drive away and we would have missed breakfast. Maybe next time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/hakuba/","title":"Hakuba"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/hottest-100-votes-for-2013/":{"body":"\nYet another year where I was slack with listening to new music.

I didn't know that Japan had bears so was pretty impressed. Apparently they thought it was a goat at first, but when they got closer decided it was a sad bear. This caused Rachael to freak out a little bit that we would run into a bear and she would be mauled.\nLater, when we saw the trail map for Iwatake they had indications of wild Japanese Serow areas, and the picture looked kind of like a goat. So we asked reception at the hotel whether Japan had any bears, and she said no that it definitely would have been a Serow.\nAt the snow monkeys they had a hut with stuffed animals, and the above picture is of a stuffed Serow. While not a bear, I still wish I had seen one in the wild.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/japanese-serow/","title":"Japanese Serow"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/jigokudani-monkey-park/":{"body":"\nSo our original snow monkey tour was rescheduled to the last day of our stay in Hakuba due to the heavy snow, so we were really lucky we even got to go. It's a shame because the first part of the bus tour as we were leaving our guide gave an overview of all the different ski resorts and which one was good for different things, something that would have been more useful at the start.\nWe got told a history of the monkey park on the way there. There was a Onsen Lodge (hot springs) in the mountains and the monkey's made trails along the hot water pipes so they didn't have to walk in the snow. Eventually one of them must have fallen in or tried the water and they decided they liked spas and took over the lodge. Due to health and safety and the fact people don't like getting in a spa full of monkey poo, the lodge built a special pool further up the mountain just for the monkeys. A national park was set up with rangers to make sure that the monkeys are not fed by tourists and that they can still live naturally.\nThe snow monkeys were really good, although the hot pool was smaller than I expected. You couldn't easily get close to the pool because loss of photographers were camped out there hogging it for the entire time. But there was monkeys everywhere throughout the park so it wasn't too bad. There is a live web cam pointed at the pool.\nIt smelt of sulphur from the hot pools which wasn't very pleasant. The monkeys basically ignore humans due to the no feeding rule, which is cool because as our guide said, it's one of the few places you can watch wild monkeys from so close in their natural habitat.\nThe rest of the tour was pretty slack, we would have been better of staying at the snow monkey park for longer.\nLunch was okay and then we had some free time in the village but it was mostly tourist shops with souvenirs and nothing too exciting. Mum and I did get to eat a marinated locust sample from one of the shops, which was quite tasty actually. You could only taste the sauce but it was very crunchy. The restaurant was the Masuichi-Ichimura Sake Brewery, which was an old Sake Brewery that has been downsized and converted into a restaurant. The food was probably our most authentic Japanese meal, although I didn't particularly think it tasted that great. The building itself was pretty cool.\nThe final part of the day was to Zenkoji Temple. The temple we went to was very cool but we were split into two groups and our guide was a volunteer with limited English. He would just point at a statue say the name and then say \"follow me to next statue\". This would have been okay if we hasn't paid so much for the tour, so we were a bit annoyed as we didn't learn anything. The monkeys only cost $5 entry, but the tour was something like $140, so next time I would just get a hire car for the day and do it that way, as it was a bit of a waste of money. The guide from the company was quite good when we did have him, but the fact that we had paid for a tour and didn't really get one ruined the experience and I wouldn't recommend it.\nThe bus ride back was interesting, due to the snow the bus barely fit through some of the streets and we caused a fair bit of traffic congestion and got back to Hakuba fairly late. I probably would have preferred an extra day on the slopes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/jigokudani-monkey-park/","title":"Jigokudani Monkey Park"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/kyoto-2/":{"body":"\nSo I'll jump a head a little bit and talk about our day trip to Tokyo. From Hakuba we got a bullet train to Osaka where we were staying, but the following day we did a day trip to Kyoto while our JR pass was still valid.\nFirst up, we went to Fushimi Inari-taisha a temple built for the Shintu god of rice, Inari. It started out a bit disappointing, as it was much like the other temples we had been to... but then it just kept going. There is a walk up the hill to a lookout and there are just gates the whole way, the amount of work that would have been involved is incredible. I really enjoyed it, although I think everyone else was put off by the fact that involved lots of walking up stairs and it really did seem endless.\nBy the time we had walked back to the bottom, everyone else was tired so it was decided we would go back to main train station to find lunch. I was happy to keep wandering until we found some lunch on the way to the next site but was outvoted. We had a really good lunch, but by the time we got to the next place I wanted to look at, SanjÅ«sangen-dÅ, it was closed. Likewise there was a few museums nearby but they were all closed for renovations as well. I guess winter is not a popular time for tourists so everything shuts early or is just closed in general.\nIt was a bit of a bummer and after that we got a train back to Osaka.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/kyoto-2/","title":"Kyoto"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/lamington-national-park/":{"body":"\nOver the Easter weekend we went on a 2-day hike in Lamington National Park with our roommate and some of his friends. It was my first time camping where you have to carry everything with you, and can't just drive to the camp site. This meant we put a lot of thought into what to bring, and took a lot less gear then normal. Ultimately this led to a much less pleasant camping experience as no swag meant for a very uncomfortable sleep, and we didn't have hot food. Also hiking with all the extra weight makes things more difficult.\nHaving said that, this is by far the best hike I have been on as the area is absolutely stunning. On the first day we did the Toolona Creek Circuit (was like 17km or something) camping at Mt Bithongabel at a bush camp site (essentially just a clearing on the side of the track). The track weaves in and out of waterfalls and the scenery just kept getting better and better.\nTowards the end of the hike, we ended up at Wanungara Lookout, which is right on the border of QLD/NSW and has a spectacular view of the valley that marks the border. Right at the lookout, we saw what we thought was a Easter Bilby (being Easter Sunday), but upon looking it up now I am home, was probably a Kangaroo-Rat.\nUnfortunately, our camp site didn't have a view due to the dense trees, and the closest lookout (probably 20 mins walk) was Toolona Lookout, which had great views but was also partly blocked by trees. At night we walked up to it to watch the stars and see the lights of the coastal towns and planes flying in to Gold Coast airport. The walk itself at night was spectacular as scattered along the way was various tree stumps full of glow worms. There was glow worms at our camp site as well.\nAs with the stars, to watch the sunrise we had to walk up to Toolona Lookout. Unfortunately the trees blocked the view of the sun, but there was beautiful views of the patches of fog in the valley below. The orange dawn light coming through the tree tops made everything look spectacular as well (photos below).\nWe were pretty buggered from the massive hike on the first day, so instead of doing the Albert River Circuit, we made a direct hike back to the car park which only took about 2 hours. There was a crazy amount of people there on the Monday, and even more cars driving up that we passed.\nIt's a magnificent area, and I'm definitely keen to come back and do some of the tracks on the Binna Burra side of the park.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/lamington-national-park/","title":"Lamington National Park"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/mrh-simulator/":{"body":"\nYesterday afternoon I went to an Engineers Australia tour of the MRH90 helicopter training simulator at Oakey Air Base.\nWe were allowed to take some photos, so here they are. Calculated using a 20 year life cycle, they said it costs $10,000 an hour to run. But that is cheaper than training in the real helicopters, which costs around $270,000/hour over the life of the helicopter.\n\n\n\nThe movement part of the simulator was turned off when we were allowed inside the cockpit, but even with just the projection screen running it tricked your brain into thinking it was real and that we were actually moving. It was extremely cool.\n\nThe control program software was pretty cool as well. They flew around over the top of Google Earth style imagery (with up to 0.1m accuracy), but the controller could also simulate enemy forces to attack them, change the weather conditions and cause things like the engine to fail.\n\nThey also brought out a $0.5mil helmet, that is the heads up display unit they use in the helicopters. It automatically adjusts to night vision, infra-red or darkens things depending on what you look at.\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/mrh-simulator/","title":"Tour of MRH Simulator"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/narita-airport/":{"body":"\nSo our trip to Japan had a terrible start. Well, it started out fine in Australia. In a crazy chance of coincidence we were seated behind a few Ergon guys I know from Townsville. Waiting at Cairns airport they taught me how to play pirate dice, which was a fun way to kill time while we waited.\nThe flight itself was okay for Jetstar. I had low expectations and they were basically met. Our problems began as we approached Japan. We were told it was snowing in Tokyo and so there would be a slight delay. At first this sounded like good news, as we were on a skiing holiday after all. After about an hour of flying in circles in heavy turbulence, most people seemed to have their sick bags at the ready. When we finally got cleared for landing it was definitely the craziest landing I've experienced. The runway was icy so we did some massive fishtails.\nGoing through security we were pleased to see snow out the window, as it was Mum, Dad, Sarah and Rachael's first time seeing snowfall. Once through security and at the train station it was a different story. There was a massive line up of people and after much confusion we eventually found out what was going on and that the trains were delayed because of the snow. After waiting in line for a few hours they finally announced that the trains were cancelled and there would be no trains that night. Buses and taxi's were also not running.\nAfter resigning ourselves to spending the night in the airport (hotels were also booked out), we tried to find food but everywhere was closed. After finding a nice spot of concrete to set down our stuff we tried to sleep. It was as comfortable as you would imagine for a block of concrete with bright fluorescent lighting and constant PA calls about delayed or cancelled flights. At one stage (around 1am) they brought out free sleeping bags which was excellent of them, except the warehouse was nearby to the spot we were camped out so it just created even more noise. According to this news story, there was also snacks distributed but we never saw any.\nThe next morning (I had about 40min sleep I think) the sun was out and so we were optimistic that the trains would be running again, as there wasn't too much snow on the runway. After waiting in line with everyone else stuck at the airport for the train station to open, we were told that the first train for the day had been cancelled but the next one would maybe run.\nAfter standing in line for a few hours they changed their mind to maybe in the afternoon, then eventually no trains that day with the train station shutting up shop. The really frustrating part was nobody seemed to know anything or want to give any answers throughout. Possibly more information was provided in the Japanese announcements, but those that spoke English weren't really willing to offer more than \"too much snow\" and \"don't know\". Perhaps it is a cultural thing where they don't want to commit to an answer that might be wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe morning at the airport was pretty chaotic. There was huge lines for all the food places. Maccas had a constant wait time of about 1.5 hours, and buy lunch time they had run out of everything except chicken nuggets and french fries. We had breakfast at a restaurant which was expensive, not very nice and had a massive wait.\nBuy lunch time we were all super depressed and tired, and there was still no news of what was happening. We had resigned ourselves to the fact that we would have to spend another night at the airport on the floor. By this stage a lot places were starting to run out of food and there was massive lines for everything. The 7/11 store was completely cleaned out, one guy I talked to was contemplating buying a kettle and a packet of pasta.\nOne place that was open at lunch and had a slightly smaller line was a Takoyaki place. Since the food was fast running out and no supplies could get in, Dad and I thought we better stock up and bought a few boxes of them for lunch/dinner. While I didn't mind the first couple this was not something you can chow down on and eat a lot of. Rachael and Sarah found them disgusting. We never heard the end of it, as Sarah felt sick for the rest of the trip when she saw one.\nAt this point it felt a bit like being in prison, we couldn't leave the airport, there was very little food, no comfortable seating (or any free seating really) and there was a massive wait to do anything. So we were all pretty heavily depressed and at the point were I think we would have been happy to turn around and fly home.\nIn the end the train line was opened late afternoon, although there was no PA call about it, dad realised when he went for a walk to go to the toilet or something. Despite not being told, there was a huge wait when we got there and an even bigger one behind us before too long, but eventually we got on the train and everyone was happy again.\nThere was heaps of snow on the side of the tracks as we entered Tokyo so we finally understood why it had been closed (although you still think they would have been more prepared). In the end we ended up getting to our hotel late that night at about the same time we had originally expected to get there the night before, so all up we were delayed by 24 hours.\nWe were pretty happy just to have a bed and shower, and so just stayed in the hotel leaving the holiday to start until the next day.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/narita-airport/","title":"Narita Airport"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/occulus-thrift/":{"body":"\nSo after the MRH90 Simulator tour I was pretty keen for the Google Cardboard that I ordered several weeks ago on sale to show up. It ended up costing $7.50 or something for 2 of them delivered.\nIt showed up on Wednesday and is pretty awesome. You install an app on your phone that uses the gyroscope to detect your head moving, and has a split screen that turns to 3d when you look through the lenses. The lenses from our cheap Chinese version aren't great so you get sore eyes after using it for a few minutes.\nThe actual demo apps themselves are incredibly trippy though. The coolest one was the 3D google earth which allowed you to fly around similar to a flight simulator. It's not as cool as the army one, but $4 is a lot cheaper then $70 million.

From there we went to Nagoya where we got to catch our first Shinkansen (bullet train) to Osaka. It wasn't as fast as I was expecting (250km/h) and was much the same as the ICE train we got in Germany.\nOur first day in Osaka, we went to Kyoto as told in the other post. Before heading back to the hotel we went to one of the shopping centres and on one floor they had PokÃ©mon Centre. I thought it might have been interesting, but really it was just a store selling PokÃ©mon Merch.\n\nSecond day we had thought about going to Hiroshima but since it was such a long train ride we decided to check out the Osaka Peace Museum about the war instead. I learnt a lot about WWII that I didn't know about and the portrayal of what happened reasonably balanced. There was some pretty disturbing photos of malnourished POWs at Changi, it made the TV show seem pretty tame.\nWhen we were finished at the museum we went to Osaka Castle in the same grounds. After doing all this boring old people stuff Sarah wanted to go back into the city to go shopping so we did that.\nWe went to the HEP Five which was a mall with a Ferris Wheel in the middle of it. On the top floor there was an arcade which was very Japanese. They had all these weird photo booths which we weren't really sure what the point of them (there was lots of them). Eventually worked out they are a thing called Pirukura which is a photo booth that does automatic photo shopping and adds items in and such. There was heaps of dressed up girls up there using them, and it was crazy how popular something is that you can probably easily do with the webcam on your computer for free.\nOn the last day everyone wanted to go to the Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan. I've been to a few aquariums recently so wasn't super excited, but it is one of the largest in the world and they had a whale shark. The whale shark was a bit of a let down though as it was quite small (about the size of some of the larger sharks they have at Sea World), although it makes sense in hindsight as the tank for a full-size one would have to be enormous.\nThe other bad thing about the aquarium was just how packed it was. It was hard to see anything up close just because there was so many people there all fighting to get a good view. It almost felt that there was more room in the tanks (and they were pretty small also). Having said that there was some animals I hadn't seen before, including one that I hadn't even heard of before, the Capybara.\nAfter the aquarium our holiday was over, and we got a bus to the Kansai Airport to head back to Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/osaka/","title":"Osaka"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/tcof-laurel-bank-and-queens-park/":{"body":"\nHere are some photos from the council parks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/tcof-laurel-bank-and-queens-park/","title":"TCOF Laurel Bank And Queens Park"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/tcof-prize-gardens-2/":{"body":"\nTom, Bec, Sarah &amp; Lewis all come up to Toowoomba for the carnival of flowers, so we went to some of the winning prize gardens.

We stayed at the Shinjuku Washington Hotel, which was fairly close to the train station and in a good area. The rooms were quite small but had everything you needed, and there was a good view out the window of the government building and the snow-covered streets.\nThe first morning we went to garden nearby and everyone made snowballs and Sarah made a mini snowman. We got wet shoes so we went shopping to department store so Sarah and Mum could get snow shoes. The roof of the shopping centre had awesome views from the top.\nAt night we went to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building nearby, which has a free lookout at the top that gives you views of the city. We also went there in the daytime, and on a clear day you are meant to be able to see Mt. Fuji, although there was too much cloud when we were there. A cool thing about Tokyo is the underground world, it was possible to walk directly to the building from our hotel and to the train station just using the underpasses and never going above ground.\nThe following night we went to Shibuya, which is the \"Times Square\" of Tokyo. There was lots happening and it is more what we were expecting of Tokyo based on what you see on TV. We went to a restaurant called Tsukuda Farm. It was really good and had excellent service. We had some marinated raw chicken which tasted awesome (if slimy and chewy) and we didn't get sick so was all good. One negative was that we got screwed on the bill as we were charged for soup and other entrees we didn't order and that we thought must have been complimentary. It wasn't the last time that we would get charged incorrectly (happened a few times during the trip) but the food was quite cheap over there anyway so we didn't worry about it.\nWe went for a day trip into Tokyo to see the Imperial Palace, which was cool but unfortunately you couldn't get too close and it was also crazy cold. Rachael wanted to see if we could see the ocean, so we walked to a park on the harbour. We had to pay entry to get in (all the other parks were free) but it was really cool. It would be a million times better in the spring as it appeared to have lots of flower fields and cherry blossoms, but everything was just covered in snow for us.\nOn the last day we walked to a park near our hotel called Meiji Jingu, which has a Shintu Temple in the middle. The park was beautiful and it's great they have things like that in the middle of the city. We paid to go to the museum in the park but it wasn't that great.\nRachael and I really enjoyed Tokyo and I would be keen to go back in Spring when all the flowers are out and it isn't so cold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/tokyo/","title":"Tokyo"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/toowoomba-food-flower-wine-festival-2014/":{"body":"\nSo we went to the carnival of flowers again this year, and it was a bit disappointing.\nThey had improved the layout this year, so we were pretty impressed on the Friday night. There was much more food to choose from this year, which was great. The bands playing weren't all that exciting though, and the wines choices weren't as good as last years. Was mostly dry wines, which Rachael and I don't like. San Cisco was to play, but it was quite cold and so we left early as we had seen them before.\nTom and Bec came from the Sunshine Coast to visit us on Saturday, but they sold out of tickets and so they couldn't get in. This basically rendered our 3-day pass useless since we didn't want to ditch them. Normally that would be fair enough, but the previous years they had no limit on the number of tickets. Last year there was way too many people their and it ruined it, so I am glad they are limiting them, but there was no indication that they would be doing so until we had already been waiting in line for 15 mins. If they had advertised that they had changed things we would have pre-booked. Not only that, Rachael and I had already paid for tickets but even if we had wanted to ditch Tom and Bec the staff said that we would need to wait in line until people left the venue to be let in. So even pre-booked tickets still did not guarantee you entrance. Given the record turnout last year on the Saturday it wasn't exactly unexpected. It was very poorly handled.\nOn the Sunday we headed their early to see Something for Kate play. They were really good and went some way to improve our impressions of the Saturday. We also went to a wine appreciation session which was kind of interesting. Sasquatch were also really good, although it started to rain towards their end of the set. It's always fun watching a band with a horn section. We didn't bother staying for the ABBA tribute band.\nAll in all, unless they have a better line up of bands for next year, or better planning in regards to the Saturday crowds, I think we will give it a miss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/toowoomba-food-flower-wine-festival-2014/","title":"Toowoomba Food, Flower & Wine Festival 2014"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2015/":{"body":"","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2015/","title":"2015"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2015/boonah-and-surrounds/":{"body":"\nRachael is doing her final nursing placement in Boonah. So prior to the placement we went for a drive to see what the town and surrounding areas were like last October.\nThe drive through Cunningham's Gap is spectacular. The western side is rainforest, and the eastern side provides views of some really steep sections of the great dividing range. There is a nice rainforest walk at the very top, but unfortunately the lookout that you walk to doesn't have a very good view.\n\n\n\n\nOn our first trip we found Lake Moogerah, which you are allowed to swim in. It was a stinking hot day and we didn't bring togs so we made sure we did the next time, but unfortunately the water wasn't as inviting the second time.\n\n\n\nWe tried to take a scenic way back to Toowoomba through Spicer's Gap and see Governor's Chair Lookout but the road is actually closed to cars at the top and so you can't drive through. It was a good lookout, but the road was very steep and dangerous especially in a Yarris (and not a 4WD) and so it wasn't really worth the effort, as you have to backtrack back down.\nBoonah itself wasn't all that exciting, although the area is full of rolling green hills which are pretty nice.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2015/boonah-and-surrounds/","title":"Boonah and Surrounds"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2015/great-ocean-road/":{"body":"\nSo after a few days in Melbourne we went back to the airport and picked up a hire car to drive the great ocean road. To drive directly to the 12 Apostles actually only takes 2 hours, but the scenic route is more like 6 hours.\nOur first stop was to check out Bell's Beach, which is just past Geelong. As you would expect the waves looked awesome, with massive barrels coming through in clean sets. The water would have been freezing though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA little bit further into the drive we saw a familiar looking lighthouse so stopped for a look.\n\n\n\nSplit Point Lighthouse is where they filmed 'Round the Twist.\nThen a fairly big drive along the coast and through some forest, was a great drive and aptly named. Eventually we made it to Gibson's Steps and the Twelve Apostles.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy this stage it was after 5, and despite the sun still being really fierce due to daylight savings, we thought we better head to Warrnambool and find some accommodation.

Melbourne has a free tram zone in the city, so all trams were free and were reasonably frequent. Was really cool to use descent public transport in Australia, although it seemed like it would have been extremely complicated if you ever needed to drive into the city for some reason. Not only do they have weird hook turns, the traffic lights are pretty insane.\n\nProbably one of the coolest buildings was the shopping centre that incorporated the old shot tower inside it.\n\n\nThere are some photos of what it looked like before the shopping centre, here and here.\nBelow are some buildings from some other cool places, Federation Square, the National Gallery of Victoria, and the State Library of Victoria (which is where they filmed this Faker Video).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went to the Eureka Skydeck, which was pretty similar to the Tokyo Government building, but double the height.

The drive to Te Anau was okay, lots of mountains and sheep but nothing too out of the ordinary to the rest of NZ. We had a long stop there at a typical tourist trap. Dad bought a shirt and they wouldn't let him buy it until he told them who our bus driver was. I would have preferred we got to spend more time in the national park or got home sooner, but that's part of being in a tour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we got into the national park the drive was awesome. A lot of the road is quite dangerous and there was tonnes of previous landslides and avalanches that had come up to or gone onto the road previous times so there was only a few dedicated areas where you were allowed to stop. Our bus had a glass roof so that you could see the snow capped mountains towering above us, but the ground level was forest, which is a pretty weird mix. There is a tunnel under one of the mountains to get through to the Milford Sound side, and then there is a rainforest. It reminded me of Lamington National Park at the gold coast, except with snow capped mountains far overhead. It was pretty strange the mix of climates all in one place. There was a Chasm Walk that was pretty cool, but not as impressive as TrÃ¼mmelbachfÃ¤lle which I saw when I was in Switzerland.\n\n\nOnce we got to Milford Sound itself (which actually is a fjord and not a sound), we got on the boat. Apperntly it rains something like 200 days of the year, but we had perfect weather. Rachael was promised the chance of penguins, seals and dolphins on her ticket and wasn't happy to we saw all three (which we did!). It is apparently rare to see the penguins so the boat went over for a closer look and we didn't go out to sea like they normally do to make up the time.\n\n\n\n\n2015-08-26 12.09.51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sheer scale of the mountains coming out of the ocean is pretty hard to comprehend when you look at them. It is a pretty incredible place.\nOne the bus back we got to see one more sight, that of an avalanche of snow falling down the mountain in front of us while we waited to enter the tunnel under it. In the photo below it looks more like a waterfall. The sheer height and sudden fall made it look like the snow was coming down in slow motion. It was pretty spectacular to watch, you wouldn't want to be in the way (we were slightly off to the side but it didn't make it to the road anyway).\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2015/milford-sound/","title":"Milford Sound"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2015/queenstown/":{"body":"\nSo we finally were able to go on our 2nd ski holiday now that Rachael got the bug in Japan, this time to New Zealand.\nWe flew into Queenstown for a night, and then mum and dad met us later in Wanaka the next day.

The sun came out on the 2nd day though before we headed off to Wanaka for the main reason of our trip, snow sports!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Queenstown Gardens had a disc golf course, something I had never heard of before but sounds super fun.

There was a fun park built for the games with truly mental jumps where they would go up this massive grind bar then do some back flips. They had TVs where you could watch as well and it didn't do it justice. I kept to the Lil' Bucks Park and Rachael even did a small jump. On the afternoon of the last day I tried to hit one of the jumps as hard as I could and stacked it, breaking the board binding and hurting my butt and hand. They still hurt today (almost 2 weeks later). Dad and I swapped for one day also and I had fun on the ski's.

The goal was to publish it on the Tales from Turgi blog and cross them off in blog posts, but I never finalised my list of 101 things. Since I was travelling lots I kept on thinking of new better ideas, and was crossing off old ones. I actually tried to make one earlier then that for the 1001 day period of 07 Jul 2009 to 24 Dec 2011, but couldn't think of 101 things I thought were worthy.

To make the most of the weekend, we left Friday and spent the first night at Mapleton. We've been to the Sunshine Coast Hinterland a few times already, so didn't go anywhere new, but it's still a lovely part of the world.\n\n\n\nOnce we met up with Tom, Bec, Sarah and Emily at Noosa, we got the ferry across to Noosa North Shore. The weather was spectacular and we drove up the beach about 40km to our camp site at the other end at Freshwater Camping Area near Rainbow Beach. Along the way we went past the cliff where Rachael did her paragliding, and stopped at a place called Red Canyon which was a an awesome canyon with red sand cliffs. There was heaps of cars on the beach but we found a camp site with nobody nearby and set up.\n\n\n\n\nAfter lunch we went for a drive and tried to get to the lighthouse at the point but the sand was too soft and the tide was coming in so we went to Rainbow Beach instead. There were more sand cliffs, which were super colourful. Coming back off the beach the tide had come in more and the sand was really chopped up and I got bogged. Tom just managed to get out but didn't want to come snatch me out in case he got bogged to. Another car came to snatch us out and they also got bogged. Eventually someone with a winch arrived and pulled us out. Then they got bogged.\nEventually everyone was out and back up above the high tide mark. Rachael had a bit of a freak out because the water was getting pretty close to the car. Once we were on our way a few more people came down on the beach and got bogged also (but higher up). It rained through most of the night so not the best camping experience but the site had hot showers and flushing toilets which is pretty incredible for a national park site on the beach. There was even a pay phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next day we went to see the Freshwater Lake for which the camp site got it's name, which was nice but not super exciting. Rachael had a go driving back and had a great (if sometimes terrified) time driving in the soft sand and getting off the beach. After getting the ferry back to Noosa we went through the automatic car wash twice and there was still sand pouring out of the car. The car's still shedding sand a week later.\nIt was a pretty spectacular part of the world, reminds me of five rocks but with lots more people.

Then it started pouring rain and Rachael sought cover in the tent so she could \"hold it up\" while I ran around trying to put in more tent pegs to counter the fact that one of the corners was missing. I was soaking wet but got it set up, only for Christian and Jaimee to arrive about 15 minutes later about when the rain stopped and easily put up theirs.\n\n\n\nThe next morning the weather was great, and so we hiked up Pyramid Rock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd since it was warmer this time, we hired some canoes in the afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had planned to take a bit of a scenic drive the next day on the way back, but woke to some thunder in the distance.

I went for one surf at high tide and didn't die so pretty happy with that.

Then it started to piss down rain and so we got soaked, but our guides brought ponchos for us so at least our clothes kept mostly dry. Due to the cloud we missed the sunrise, but eventually it started to clear and we could see through the clouds at the spectacular view below.\nWe then went over the lip to where the steam vents were and were instantly warmed up. Our guides cooked eggs and banana sandwiches for us in the steam from the volcano which was pretty neat.\nThe rest of the morning was great weather and we could admire the views for the walk down. There was no hot lava, but you could see black lava flows from when the volcano last erupted in 1999. Walking down the lava 'sand' was pretty bizarre as it was super loose fine rock that you could slide down on a bit like you were skiing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a great hike and one of the highlights of our trip.\nWe picked up our bags from the hotel in Ubud on the way back, and then traveled onward to Keramas for the wedding.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2016/mt-batur/","title":"Mt Batur"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2016/murwillumbah/":{"body":"\nSince we spent Christmas in Toowoomba this year, Rachael wanted to head to the beach for New Years. Given we tried booking about a day before, almost everywhere at Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast were booked, and so we decided to stay inland a bit at Murwillumbah YHA.&nbsp; The area around there was great and there was awesome views from the deck of the Tweed River and Mt Warning.\nOn the drive down we stopped around the Palm Beach area and it was busy as. Across the border a bit Cabarita Beach was reasonably quiet and much more pleasant. We had dinner at a pub in Murwillumbah overlooking the river and watched heaps of fish jumping out of the water at sunset. This put Rachael off swimming (Bull Sharks?) but there was plenty of people water skiing.\nThe main attraction is to climb Mt Warning, but it's quite a long hike so we just went for a drive to have a look around and ended up going to Natural Bridge as it is nearby and on the way back home. The other two times we went there was lots of people but because we got there about 9am we were the first car there and the walk was way better. A group of motorbikes arrived as we were leaving to ruin the peaceful forest sounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also decided to go to the spit at South Port on the way home which was a good reminder why we would never want to live at the Gold Coast because the traffic was horrendous.

We saw signs for it last time and tried to find it, but somehow walked straight past it. It was pretty fun climbing to the top of the tree, so was definitely worth coming back. Turns out it was super easy to find from the car park, but was not well signed when coming from the opposite direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe camp sites were pretty good, almost like a caravan park as we were so close to the cafe and BBQ areas. Much different to the last time we camped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sunday we did an actual hike, heading to Picnic Rock which is the way we went last time. Jaimee, Christian and I went a bit past here and turned off and did the last part of the Box Forest Circuit. The Box Forest Falls themselves were spectacular and probably the highlight of the trip.

We stayed in a private villa with a pool near Double Six beach and the rooms were pretty awesome. Double Six beach was pretty good, lots of bands playing in the sand at night for the restaurants which was awesome. Less awesome was the creeks running into the ocean that smelt of sewerage. Tom and I went for a surf one morning and the water was mostly clean but a little bit of rubbish would float past now and again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a nice place but super touristy and busy, so (Rachael and I at least) were pretty keen to get out to see the rest of Bali.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2016/seminyak/","title":"Seminyak"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2016/tegenungan-waterfall-and-goa-gajah/":{"body":"\nWe had a free day in Keramas, so thought we would head back to Ubud to see some of the places we didn't have time for. The videographer for the wedding, James, was staying next door and suggested Tegenungan Waterfall and came along for a drive. There was barely anyone there when we got there. You are allowed to swim and so we jumped in and stood under the falls. The power of the water coming down was incredible, and literally took your breath away when you were standing directly underneath the torrent of water. There was also a cool little hike to the top where we saw some wild monkeys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then headed into town to go to the markets, but Rachael spotted Kemenuh Butterfly Park on the way so we stopped there. Was similar to the one in Changi Airport but much bigger, and they had sections with larvae and caterpillars so you could see all the different stages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter looking at some shops and getting a massage, we headed to Goa Gajah which was a cool little cave temple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas a great day.

Just up the road was the Ubud Monkey Forest so after our welcome drink we headed straight there.\nThe monkeys themselves were okay, but the forest had an awesome walk through a stream and a temple so it was well worth the visit. As we were leaving we noticed that there were heaps of Monkeys' running on the roofs of the buildings in the town and climbing down the power poles which was a pretty crazy sight. In the forest, there were heaps of people selling food that you could give to the monkey's which we thought was a bit weird but made sense in that it keeps them from going into the town and stealing food.\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone else wanted to get massages so Rachael and I went into town and had lunch at an awesome Italian place that made an amazing pizza. We then went to the Agung Rai Museum of Art (ARMA) which cost a fair bit to get in for Bali ($10AUD) but was awesome. There were some incredible paintings but even cooler since we didn't expect it was the grounds of the museum itself which had all kinds of cool gardens and even some rice fields. Rachael in particular loved it which was great because she wasn't a huge fan of the hustle and bustle of Seminyak.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally we headed back to the hotel to make used to the pool before our volcano hike the next day.

At the temple we saw our first monkeys and they stole the sunglasses from another girl there. The cliffs that it overlooked were cool and you could see why they would want to have built a temple there. We then went to Panang Panang Beach, was stunning but then it started to pour rain so we left. To get onto the beach you need to walk through a tight cave. There was a local woman carrying large blocks of ice up and down the stairs through the cave.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe drove past Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park and Gede recommended we stop, and inside they had huge stone statues as well as pillars of limestone that had been carved into. It is still in progress and it was pretty great to see something of that scale being created in modern times. There was also some traditional Balinese dancing shows that we watched a little bit of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then picked up Tom and Bec from Seminyak which involved lots of sitting in traffic at a speed slower then walking. Eventually we got on the 'highway' and our driver recommended an awesome place to stop for lunch, Kedai 68, which was probably the best food we had on the trip.\n\n\n\nOn the way our driver recommended we go to Pura Taman Ayun which was a pretty cool temple that was surrounded by water. It as pretty cool but we had to drive through lots of traffic to get there so might have been better to skip it or leave for another day.\n\n\nFinally we got to Tanah Lot, which is a temple on a rock at sea. We got there at high tide and so you can't get across without swimming. It was a pretty spectacular place for a temple but packed with tourists and locals selling things, which made it a bit hard to really appreciate the views. Further along there was a another temple on the cliff and even a bit of a beach. It reminded me a little bit of the Great Ocean Road in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a great day and we saw lots of really cool things, but by the end of it we were sick of being in the car and glad to be moving away from the traffic a bit to head inland to Ubud.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2016/uluwatu-and-tanah-lot/","title":"Uluwatu and Tanah Lot"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/":{"body":"","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/","title":"2017"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/alnwick/":{"body":"On our drive south we wanted to go to the beach. Rachael was navigating so took us to what looked like a sandy beach on the map but was actually Lindisfarne causeway, which was a massive salt pan at low tide. After looking it up we thought about driving across to Lindisfarne Castle but it was really foggy and we didn't really know how fast the tides are so thought it was best not to in a rental car.\nIt felt really familiar though, and I realised it was the island from the second episode of the Vikings TV show which I had only just watched before leaving Australia. We drove to a beach a bit further south and tried to see Lindisfarne Castle from there, and could make it out but the weather was still really foggy so not very good views.\nWe went to the next beach south though and saw Bamburgh Castle, which was really impressive. The beach itself was actually surprisingly good compared to what I pictured for England. It kind of reminded me of Farnborough, but foggy and cold.\n\n\nThe little village our AirBnB was at was really nice, and there was a field of rapeseed (canola oil) across the road.\n\nWe walked up the road to an indian place for dinner, and we were pretty much the only ones there (was a bit early) but was probably one of the best Indian restaurants we've been too.\nWe stayed at Alnwick because I saw the poison garden on atlas obscura and we thought it would be interesting, but it wasn't actually that exciting. It was mostly just vegetables and spices, like Rosemary and Lavender which we have in our garden. They did have some interesting one's like monkshood and deadly nightshade but nothing was flowering at the time. They also grow drugs there, but they weren't out while we were there as they keep them locked up most the year.\n\nThe Alnwick Garden's themselves were pretty nice though. The highlight was a section with heaps of different water fountain designs.\n\nTom Scott did a video on it about a month after we were there:\n\nThe castle next door looked pretty cool also, although we didn't go in.\n\nAfter Alnwick we were heading to the Lakes District on the other side of the country, but we wanted to drive along Hadrian's Wall. It was a great drive in general, with lots of rolling green hills with sheep.\nThe wall was impressive in that something nearly 2000 years old is still there. We went to a museum showing some of the roman history although we could have just done free stuff they implied you had to pay to walk up to the wall (which you don't for most of it).\n\n\n\nThe latrine was most impressive showing they had plumbing back then.\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/alnwick/","title":"Alnwick and The Wall"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/belfast/":{"body":"We flew into Belfast and got a bus in to the city and then to check into our hostel. Everywhere was really booked out in Belfast, and we were only able to book a 10 person dorm at Vagabonds. We found an awesome burrito place for lunch that was a cross between subway and GyG. It was good being back in an English speaking country again, although Rachael still really struggled to understand what we were ordering with the accent which was pretty funny.\nThe hostel was really cool, but hopefully we never have to book a 10 bed dorm again. Luckily we went to bed pretty early before everyone else got back, because apparently one guy was snoring so loud that one of the other girls didn't sleep (and told us at breakfast she wanted to murder him). I woke up in the morning and heard him, and probably wouldn't have been able to sleep hearing it.\n\nThe living area was really cool, and we spoke to some other people in the hostel about where to visit while we were in Ireland. We didn't think we would have time to get to the Cliffs of Moher but were persuaded it was worth the drive.\nMy phone plan had expired, but since we were back in the UK we could head into the city to renew it. The shopping centre had a really cool viewing platform where you could see the city, although the weather wasn't great for visibility.\nWe did a free walking tour later on in the morning, starting at City Hall. They had a display of all the people who died on the titanic, including two people that were under stolen identities. I didn't actually realise the Titanic was built there and they also had a whole 'Titanic Experience' which is a apparently great visit (similar to the Vasa Museum I guess) but we didn't have time to visit.\nNext on the tour, we went to the Europa hotel, which was bombed repeatedly by the IRA. It was opposite a really fancy bar, which joined on to another bar called Fibber's McGee (like in Toowoomba).\nWe saw the leaning clock, wise salmon, and I think four 'oldest bar in Belfast'. There was a really cool part of town with lots of pubs and restaurants that was a bit hipster with lots of cool graffiti.\n\nIt was a really good tour, and Belfast was a surprisingly cool city and a shame we didn't more time there.\nFor lunch we had some amazing burgers, they like their make your own takeaway and this was like a Grill'd crossed with subway. They tasted amazing and were really cheap.\nThere was a free Ulster museum and botanical gardens near(ish) our hostel so we went there in the afternoon. The museum had a display of the period table with all the actual elements (stable ones at least). And we learnt a bit about 'the troubles' and the IRA as this wasn't covered in the tour we did. The gardens were nice too.\n\nA lot of the pubs in town had cool names, like Filthy McNasty and The Dirty Onion. Our tour guide talked up going to see some Irish Music at Fitzy's, and there was a local duo of girls playing that were really good, but it was more American/Pop/Country then Irish.\n\nThe next morning we picked up a hire car to explore the country side.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/belfast/","title":"Belfast"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/berlin/":{"body":"\nWe got in to Berlin quite late, but got up early the next day to do the free walking tour.\nWe learnt heaps of history about the war, and the berlin wall and cold war.\nOne of the first stops was the Jew Memorial which when we saw it was really familiar as I'd seen it on TV and the internet. The designer did a great job, as when you walk through it, it's nothing like what you expect. All the blocks are slightly different and in the middle it goes really deep and some are really tall. The guide said the designer refused to explain what it represented, and it was up to everyone that visited to interpret it for themselves. Reading the wiki article though, it says it was \"designed to produce an uneasy, confusing atmosphere, and the whole sculpture aims to represent a supposedly ordered system that has lost touch with human reason\" which actually describes it really well. Each of the minorities that were persecuted got their own memorial, rather then grouping them all together, which is a nice thought. Our guide also pointed out how great it is that the Germans are so open about the past, to ensure it doesn't happen again with the memorials in the middle of the city on prime real estate. Pretty much all the ex-colonies (like Australia) have a terrible history where they invaded, but that's mostly ignored so I think it's really great that they acknowledge it. The German parliament was also a cool building, with a see through viewing platform above it so you can look down on the politicians and they can always look up to see who they represent (the tour guide pointed out mostly tourists). You need to book an appointment ages in advance though, so unfortunately we couldn't go up. Thinking about it also reminded me of a comment Jan said to me when he visited on Australia Day, and about how great he thought it was to have a day where we could celebrate your nationality and that they can't really have that.\n\n\nWe also visited the car park which was built on top of the bunker where Hitler shot himself, and saw parts of the Berlin Wall and Checkpoint Charlie. The tour stopped at a cafe for lunch which actually had cheap but amazing chicken schnitzel bagels. The final stop was wear a large book burning took place, and the square had an underground room which you could look down into, that had bookshelves with no books on them.\nAfter the tour, we walked to museum island, and there appeared to be some sort of political rally going on. When we got closer we saw that they were filming movie. All the museums had awesome architecture, but were expensive so we didn't go in.\n\nThe next day we went to the Menschen Museum which was the thing that Rachael was most looking forward to in Berlin. It was okay, I was expecting it to be more about science but it was presented more like an art gallery. Seeing a real spinal cord and the tiny bone in your ear were pretty cool though. Afterwards we had lunch at an amazing Vietnamese restaurant. Germany was great for having amazing cheap food after being in the Scandinavian countries.\nIn the afternoon we walked along the East Side Gallery which is a section of the Berlin Wall near where we were staying with murals. Apparently it's the hipster part of town and their are clubs that are open 24/7 (haven't closed in like 7 years) and a club that you have to wait in line for like 4 hours only to probably get told that you are dressed wrong and can't come in. it was weird to think about something like that happening so recently in history (when I was a baby as opposed to before I was born anyway). On the other side of the river there were definitely lots of hipster restaurants and we went to a park that actually seemed like American parks you see in the movies.\n\nWe decided to visit Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp which was as miserable as you would imagine but worth the visit. The weather was very appropriate with a bitter cold wind making it horrible to stand outside in our jackets (in Spring), while we were told that prisoners had to stand out basically wearing nothing for hours on end in the middle of winter. Given the prisoners were essentially worked to death in -20, we couldn't complain too much.\n\nWe decided to go to a a German pub for dinner to lighten the mood and had some good beer, and okay food. Afterwards we popped in for a drink at HofbraÃ¼ Berlin so Rachael could get a small taste of what Oktoberfest was like.\n\nNext day we caught a train to a church that was destroyed in the war and left up as a memorial. Was pretty crazy seeing all the artillery holes in the side of the walls, and the damage inside.\n\n\nWe then got a bus to the Tiergarten and climb up the victory column (which I had never heard of). It also had bullet holes on it, was a good view from the top but very crowded. They should limit number of people at a time, as it ruined the experience a bit and we wouldn't have minded a small wait. It was a very long staircase climb to the top. There was a cool underpass system under the roundabout, and there was a busker playing guitar that found the perfect spot to play so that it echoed all over the square and sounded awesome.\n\n\nFor lunch we got amazing kebabs that had chips in them, and Rachael had a Halloumi one which was equally awesome. Berlin really does have great street food.\nFinally, we went to the gardens at Schloss Charlottenburg, which were good but not super amazing.\n\nWe had to get up really early for our flight, and then when we got there it was closed until 2 hours before our flight. When they did eventually open there was huge lines and security was super tedious and badly organised, it seemed very un-german compared to their rail system.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/berlin/","title":"Berlin"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/bled/":{"body":"We got a train from Ljubljana to Lesce-Bled to a cool hostel that used to be a monastery.\nWe got a bus to Bled itself and hiked up to the castle that overlooks the lake.\n\n\n\nWe were going to hire a boat but it started to rain, so we had lunch and waited a bit for it to clear.\nOne thing we weren't expecting were the huge snow-covered alpine mountains in the background.\nAlso that lots of things would be closed, one gorge we wanted to visit unfortunately didn't open until a week later.\nThe sun came out for a bit, so we looked at renting a boat again, but only one place was open and they recommended against it in case it rained again.\nThe tourist information centre recommended hiking up Osojnica, which was a bit steeper then we were epecting but had great panoramic views of the lake.\n\n\n\nThe next day we went canyoning, which had been recommended to us and was the main reason we came to Bled.\nThe water was pretty cold, and we only got wetsuits this time (not drysuits) but it was incredibly fun.\nRachael did better then I was expecting and only really struggled with the first jump. Because it was very early in the tourist season it was just us and the guide. The water was also full of salamanders.\n\n\n\nIn the afternoon we went back to Bled to get a boat this time and row to island. It was fun being on the water, but the island itself wasn't too exciting.\n\nWe still had one day free and with the gorge closed, we decided to go on a hot air balloon ride.\nWe had to get up really early, then set a helium balloon off to work out the launch site.\nAgain, it ended up being a private ride as it was early in the season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur pilot was Slovenian but had just come back from Melbourne, where he works part of the year as his daughter lives there now. So he'd actually left Australia after us. He was a really interesting guy and runs the company with his wife.\n\nAfter the ride we had some champagne to celebrate the successful flight (and Rachael got quite drunk). And then we headed back to Lake Bled for some Bled Cake, which is basically an amazing vanilla slice.\nWe then spent most of the rest of the day relaxing and planning where we were going next (finding accommodation and transport over Easter late notice proved quite difficult).\nWhile waiting for our train to Austria the next day, we saw a train go past with carriage after carriage of brand new Mercedes.\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/bled/","title":"Bled"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/channel/":{"body":"So we left Dublin early in the morning to avoid the traffic and made our way up north again to visit Slane.\nWe were told by Matt and Angela to visit a hill with a view of the countryside and was a perfect sunny day so the views were spectacular.\nThere was a freezing cold wind though, so we didn't stay long.\n\n\nWe went past Slane Castle but it was closed for renovations.\nNearby is the site of Newgrange, but we got there really early and it didn't open until 9:30 so we just looked over the hedge.\n\nWe made a quick detour to drive along the ocean and then we were back across the Northern Ireland border.\nThere is no real signage other then the speed limits suddenly change from km/h to miles/h.\nWe still had a few hours with the car before we had to return it, so we went up to look at Cavehill which is a mountain that inspired Gullivers Travels as apparently it looks like a giant and people hiking up its face inspired the author.

But it was only a short trip so we just read and went on top to look at Scotland as we came in.\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/channel/","title":"Last Day in Ireland"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/copenhagen/":{"body":"\nFrom Varberg, it is as simple as catching a commuter train across the sea to Denmark. Which is pretty crazy, and Johan mentioned how sometimes he pops over to Copenhagen to do some shopping!\nWe ended up booking a boat to stay on through airBnB for something different. It was kind of cool, Rachael wasn't a fan as it had a pump toilet and the shower was apparently terrible. But it was a cool novel place to stay for one night.\n\nWe had planned to do a walking tour that day, but were my card stopped working so we couldn't get any cash out until I got it unfrozen and Danish Kroner are different to the Swedish Kroner and Icelandic Kroner. The changing exchange rate was also annoying, I'm glad the Euro now exists for some countries at least.\nSo we ended up doing all the free things we could find in Copenhagen, and paying for things we had to (like food) on the credit card. We got a metro driverless train to the city, which were really regular and pretty fast. We stopped to have a look at the Church of our Saviour, which had a really cool tower. Unfortunately there was a huge line to go up and it cost money, so we decided to keep exploring.\n\nThere are lots of cool canals, this one had some sort of statue under the water.\n\nIt was stunningly good weather, and we walked through The King's Garden which was nice, but would have been even nicer about a week later as everything was just starting to bloom but not quite. From here we walked across to the botanic gardens, which had a greenhouse which was steaming hot.\n\nThere were some great little walks and the lake, with heaps of people out enjoying the sunshine (although it was still cold). There were heaps of cyclists on the streets, we saw 2 heavily pregnant women riding which made Rachael concede that she probably can manage the short ride to work in the morning in Toowoomba where it's not really that cold.\n\n\nThen more walking to dockside (we had a day ticket for the metro but walking wasn't much slower), although we ended up doing ~18km each day so was pretty tiring. They had lots of pretty shops along the canal, but all a bit fancy for me.\n\nWe then walked up to Kastellet Fortress, stopping at the Little Mermaid statue along the way (pretty unexciting). The fortress was really cool, the rampart is in the shape of a star so we walked along the rim of it, there were lots of people out for a jog, which would be a cool little daily circuit.\n\n\nFinally, we stopped in at a big dome church on the way back to the boat.\n\n\nFor dinner we went to a cafe in a shopping centre, which was very average for the price and we got table water and they charged us like $5 for it.\nThe next day Rachael found out there was a museum that was free on Tuesdays. But it didn't open until 11, so first we went to see the Tivoli Gardens (which were basically closed for winter) and City Hall. City Hall was a beautiful building, and had a thing called the Jens Olsen's World Clock which I thought was really fascinating (Rachael not so much). It had things such as the time in all the different time zones, as well as positions of the planets, and adjusts the date for leap years, which is incredible for a mechanical clock but probably taken for granted now that it's done automatically by software on our phones.\n\n\nThe Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek (the free museum Rachael found) would have absolutely been worth the price of admission and was huge.\nSome of the art was a bit plain, but the statues were amazing. There was a nice garden in the middle as well. They also had some side exhibits like some egyptian mummies and roman sculptures.\n\n\n\nAfterwards we went to see another garden in the city and then caught the metro back to grab our bags and catch our flight.\nWe made one more detour to Kastrupfort Fortress which was way less impressive then the other one, but had a good view of some wind farms out at sea.\nIt was an exhausting two days, but we saw a lot and were really glad that we made the stop on the way to Berlin instead of flying directly.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/copenhagen/","title":"KÃ¸benhavn"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/croatia/":{"body":"We landed in Zagreb and picked up our rental car. We wanted to go to see the Plitvice Lakes but after looking at transport options decided a rental car was our only option and we wouldn't have time to go visit any of the beaches in Croatia. Because multiple drivers costs lots more, we got it in Rachael's name and then she she had a bit of a mild panic attack because you drive on the other side of the road and the gears were reversed. Once we got off the highway the roads were terrible and everyone was speeding, and we thought maybe we had made a terrible decision.\nBut eventually we got there and the lakes were incredible! Well even the car park area was cool and the burgers at the information centre delicious.\nThen we walked down to the lakes and there were just waterfalls everywhere. The water was crystal clear and the wooden walkways just above it on cool wooden planks. We didn't realise there was actually a recommended circuit until later, but we did a big walk on one side and then got a boat to other side. Then we did another big walk with even bigger waterfalls and a cool cave system. It was unlike anywhere else I've been in the world and absolutely worth the visit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe accommodation was okay and easy to find. We had a great (fancy but cheap) dinner up the road that had calamari with mash and Turkey with gnocchi. Having the exchange rate work on your favour again was great.\n\nUnfortunately the next day we had to have another stressful drive back to Zagreb. We did stop at a cool town on the way that had waterfalls under the buildings. And we managed to return the car without incident, and were glad to be rid of it!\n\nFrom Zagreb we got a FlixBus to Slovenia, because it's outside the Schengen Zone there was a crazy border crossing had trucks backed up for kilometers.\n\nIt was a bit intimidating as they didn't really explain what was going on (not in English anyway), but after waiting around for ages and getting our passports stamped we were back on our way.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/croatia/","title":"PlitviÄka Jezera"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/dna-family-tree/":{"body":"While we were mostly interested in the health aspect, the main selling point on ads for DNA tests is seeing your ancestry.\nI was expecting the results for that part to be pretty underwhelming, and they were - confirming I am indeed descended from European immigrants.\n\nThe matching is really interesting though, it finds sections of your DNA that match that of others, and sums the shared segments which are measured in centimorgans.\n\nI knew the relationship to a match on Mum's side (blue) and one on dad's (blue), so you can see the parts of the DNA that come from which side when comparing to those peoples results.\n\nThe one on mum's side was an X-Match, which makes sense because you get the X from your mum's side.\nYou can do Y and mt tests to see direct lines, but that's not part of the cheaper autosomal tests we got, which only tests small segments not your full genome.\n\nIf you don't actually know how you are related (like 99% of my matches) you can make a rough guess about how closely related you are based on the cM's, which is how paternity tests work.\n\nConsidering the first DNA tests were only done in the 80s, I thought it was pretty cool to be able to see how DNA is passed on with your own results, and the detail you can match people to with a bit of spit.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/dna-family-tree/","title":"DNA Genealogy"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/dna-health/":{"body":"Last year I was listening to a Podcast on 23andMe where they talked up what the benefits to health care would be if everyone did DNA testing. Different drugs affect people differently, and apparently DNA is a good way of isolating how they will impact different groups. Also if you know you are more suspeptible to certain diseases you can potentially make lifestyle changes to reduce them, and it can also tell you what you are a carrier of if you are planning to have children.\nUnfortunately, they don't offer the health component in Australia as interpreting the results is a bit controversial. They do offer ancestry tests though as do lots of other companies. I found that their is an external site\nPromethease that lets you upload the raw data from other sites, and it will give you health info (although in a much more academic format).\nIt sounded interesting, so I was going to order the $99USD test but they charged a massive $100USD in shipping so would have been about ~$365AUD all up for 2 kits. FamilyTreeDNA ended up being $205 AUD all up for two (on special) so we went with them. The companies do actually all test different parts of your DNA (not the whole thing) so they aren't the same but figured they'd all be good enough. Smarter Every Day has a simple video (ad) on what the difference is.\nSo once we sent our saliva over to the US and waited for a few weeks, we got our raw results and then the health ones.\nNot surprisingly I have the gene for red hair.\n\nThe other results were also pretty expected, some increased risks of cancers which we already had family history of. Neither of us are likely to be lactose intolerant (we aren't), although Rachael apparently carries a gene that makes her more likely to be allergic to peanuts (she isn't).\nMost of it is to do with drug resistances and effectiveness, which was the whole point made in the podcast in favour of DNA testing for health. If doctors are aware of your results they can make more informed drug prescriptions.\n\nI hadn't heard of most of them but Rachael had, might prove useful information to know if we ever get sick in the future.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/dna-health/","title":"DNA Health Care"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/dover/":{"body":"\nLauren has a car so we thought we would take advantage of it and do a day trip somewhere she hadn't been yet, so headed to see the White Cliffs of Dover and Dover Castle. I was surprised how quickly we got to more rural areas, as I was expecting heaps of urban sprawl like Brisbane, but London is actually pretty contained.\nWe decided to ignore the National Trust tourist part and headed further up towards the St Margaret's Bay end where we hoped there would be less people. The cliffs were really awesome, they looked like they were made of chalk and where we went there was no fences just walking tracks and then edge. The walk from the road where we parked was also nice with a bit of forest with wildflowers and some abandoned buildings. It was also cool driving in and seeing the harbor which had lots of massive ships coming and going.\n\n\nNext we went to look at Dover Castle, which was even a cool drive in as we had to drive under a medieval archway. The ticket price was pretty expensive but it was a massive grounds and had heaps of things to see.\nFirst we did a tour of underground war hospital. The small amount of the tunnels we saw was pretty extensive and hard to imagine from above. Living down there during the war would have been pretty horrible.\n\n\nThere was a display about some of the various wars between France and how the ownership of the castle had changed, but the highlight by far was the actual castle itself. It was massive and had heaps of little side tunnels and staircases which were almost all open to walk through. They had some displays set up to show how it would have been furnished in the day also. It was interesting how small the beds were because they slept sitting up due to the smoke making it hard to breathe lying down.\n\n\n\nAlso cool was the medieval tunnels, which went pretty deep into the ground and were impressive fortifications for the time. We had not expected to stay long but there was so many things to see we were there for hours. The 2,000 year old Roman Lighthouse was crazy to think it was still standing, and the Roman Church was also pretty cool.\n\nWe went into town to get some lunch, but the town itself wasn't that great. It was a bit smelly and nothing particularly interesting to see.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/dover/","title":"Dover"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/dublin/":{"body":"We got in from our drive in the afternoon, and parked at our airBnB which was hosted by a really lovely guy that made us a cuppa, gave us a map and helped us plan out what we wanted to see the next day. It was a bit of a dodgy suburb but lots of good student food places nearby, and we had some amazing Moroccan wraps.\nThe next morning we did a walking tour, and in more stereotypical Irish weather it was raining and cold.\nOur guide was great and started with a history of Ireland, which was the first I really had properly learnt about the backstory to the potato famine and conflict with the English.\nThe first main stop was Dublin Castle and the The Dubhlinn (Black pool) Gardens.\n\n\nWe went to a church that became a pub, and the Temple Bar area. Finally we finished up at Trinity college, which was a beautiful university.\n\nOur guide showed us the incredible old library, and the ugly arts building directly opposite. He told us how it was meant to be a recreation of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon but the concrete they used didn't support plants (turns out this isn't true).\nAfter talking up the Book of Kells and how it was once the most valuable item in the world, and how the library is like being in harry potter, we had to visit. Rachael loved the exhibit on the Book of Kells, but I was less impressed as I had seen something similar at the Abbey library of St. Gallen, although I remember being super impressed back then.\nThe upstairs library itself was crazy impressive though, and they also had the original Brian Boru's Harp that often represents Ireland as a logo.\n\nRachael doesn't like beer so instead of visiting Guinness we went to the Irish Whiskey museum. There was a bit of a history about how it was invented and how Scotland stole their glory with their 'inferior Scotch Whiskey'. And then we got to sample a few different styles. The most crazy thing I learnt was that some whiskey tastes better with water and some not. There was one in particular that just completely changed in flavour when you added the tinniest drop of water.\n\nMatt told us that we had to track down Molly Malone, and that when we saw her we'd know where to rub for good luck.\n\nOur guide pointed out when we were at the castle another great free library, the Chester Beatty Library so we went there as well. It had lots of religious history and I learnt about a few religions I hadn't heard of and about some of the specific differences between Islam/Judaism/Christianity.\n\nWe went to a nice park on the way home (St Stephen's Green), and found a University for Newman Studies.\n\nThen we found an even nicer park, the Iveagh Gardens.\n\nWe went to an asian place for dinner called Neon noodles which was delicious, and you got a free soft serve with your noodles which was a bit unusual.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/dublin/","title":"Dublin"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/edinburgh/":{"body":"After getting off the ferry we had a nice coastal drive on the bus to Edinburgh, briefly stopping at Glasgow on the way.\nEdinburgh is a really cool looking city, with lots of nice buildings.\nWe went to our airBnB which overlooked Arthur's Seat and was hosted by a really nice guy Russell, who told us that the layers actually inspired the theory of tectonic plates.\nThe next morning we did the free walking tour and had an awesome guide, Sabela. We got to see some multi-level architecture, with buildings that have either 4 or 11 floors depending which side you go to because it's so hilly. We saw some alleys, which are called a Close (because the builds are so close). We played the game Local or Tourist, where you watch people walk past the Heart of Midlothian and see if they sidestep and spit on it or stop to look at the pretty love heart. We heard of Deacon Brodie who was a keymaker by day who robbed his clients by night and half-hangit Maggie. Rachael's favorite story was about the guys who stole The Stone of Destiny - which we saw later at the castle.\nWe learnt about how the church taught people to read the bible and learning to read brought about the Scottish Enlightenment which brought about a whole bunch of philosophers like David Hume who was the first to promote the idea that you could have morals without religion. Since Edinburgh had all these philosophers they wanted to become Athens of the North and so built their own Parthenon at Calton Hill.\nWe visited Greyfriars Kirkyard which is a cemetery behind the cafe where J.K. Some of the people buried there include Thomas Riddle, a McGonagall and a Pettigrew.\n\nThere was also a grave for Gregyfriars Bobby, which was a dog that guarded the grave of its owner for 14 years after he died, which reminded me of the Futurama episode Jurrasic Bark.\n\nAfter our tour we doubled back to St Giles' Cathedral and the Thistle Chapel, which is inside the cathedral but not part of it, and is where the Scottish knights meet once a year and was pretty interesting to learn about.\n\nWe then did a tour of Edinburgh Castle which had great views of the city, lots of cool rooms, and the crown jewels.\n\n\n\n\nWe also saw the hall where the actual red wedding took place.\n\nThe next day we went to the National Museum of Scotland, which was pretty good.\n\nThey had a display on all the extinct animals which was interesting because they were all mostly from Australia or New Zealand. I guess they killed off everything in Europe before they had a chance to name all the species.\nThey also had a cool exhibit on communication history (telegraph, ocean internet cables) and a pretty good power and energy display. And they had Dolly the Sheep.\n\nIn the afternoon we walked up to see the Athens of the North.\n\n\nAnd then we climbed Arthur's seat, which had spectacular views and was a great little hike. We also saw our first pheasant.\n\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/edinburgh/","title":"Edinburgh"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/first-day-in-london/":{"body":"\nOur first stop in our Europe trip was to London to visit Rachael's sister Lauren.\nSo after a Uber to the bus station, a bus to Brisbane, a long flight to Bangkok, a long boring layover and then an even longer flight to London, we arrived at Heathrow.\nLauren met us at arrivals and then we got our first tube ride to Hammersmith and then a bus to her place. Her place was pretty cool and very stereotypical of what you would expect in London, with a very steep staircase and a cupboard under the stairs. It was a lovely day and all the trees in her street were in flower also.\n\n\nAfter we had unpacked and had a chance to catch up, Rachael and I got the tube to Kensington to find a Three Store and get a cheap SIM so we would have data on our trip (the plan had free roaming in the other countries we were going to). From there we were headed to the museums but walked through Hyde Park on the way (looking at a map now it was technically Kensington Gardens).\n\n\nWe were not expecting to seen anything like the Albert Memorial, which was enormous and the gold was extremely bright in the sun. And it was opposite the awesome-looking Royal Albert Hall, which I had heard of but didn't realise it was opposite a park or a giant gold statue.\n\nFrom here we walked past lots of embassy buildings to go see the Natural History Museum. This is actually a building that we knew looked awesome, except the front entrance was blocked off and under renovations and so we couldn't actually see it. Inside was pretty cool, although we had higher expectations and it wasn't that different to other museums really, just a lot larger.\n\nNext we wanted to go to the science museum, but between the two we quickly popped into the Victoria museum which had Raphael posters which were 'on loan from Her Majesty the Queen'. You would think it would just be donated to the museum, but good you could seem the for free. Rachael liked all the old clothes which were the majority of the displays.\nMy favourite place was the Science museum. It had heaps of cool displays especially the space exhibits and large projected globe with various satellite imagery.\n\n\nAfter the museums we met back up with Lauren at Hyde Park. From there it was a short walk to Buckingham palace and Trafalgar square. It was really crazy how close all the main sights are to each other, and how close Lauren was staying to the city also.\n\nWe had lunch and then walked to Westminster to see Big Ben and parliament.\n\nOnce we got home I was wrecked from not sleeping in about 2 days, so Rachael and Lauren want to get some fish and chips for dinner but I fell asleep.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/first-day-in-london/","title":"First Day in London"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/foster-dogs/":{"body":"\nSo since we got a house Rachael has wanted a dog, but since we were planning on going overseas for a while it didn't make sense to get one. Then Ebony suggested we just foster dogs, which is the perfect system because when you need to go away or just get sick of them you can take them back, and in the meantime your providing a home fora dog that would otherwise be in a tiny kennel at the RSPCA.\nOur first dog was Kel, the Kelpie. He had a really bad gash on his back so couldn't be adopted until it had healed over. He was a great dog but was so energetic we couldn't tire him out no matter how hard we tried. We had him almost 2 months, then he had to go back while we went to Bali. Somebody eventually adopted him.\n\nOur next foster dog was less successful, pretty much immediately jumping the fence for the chicken coup and killing one of them, so we had to take him back. We then got Ducky, who was a lovely dog but got sick and had to catch the dog ambulance down to the vet at Wacol. After he got better again, he was fostered out to someone down there.\n \nAt the moment we have Lola, who was pregnant when we got her last year and now has 9 puppies. It's been pretty cool watching them grow up, and seeing the birth itself.\n\n\n\n\nWe had them during the heat wave, on New Years Day it got to 40Â°C. I put a fan on them and heaps of little bowls of water to cool down in, but Lola decided to instead dig a big hole in the garden and pick them up and put them in that.\n\n\nThey are just getting big enough now to run around and becoming super playful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are going back next week for adoption, which will be good for our patio which gets constantly covered in poo.

Okay view from outside but heaps of midgies, we didn't both going inside. There was a wedding on at the church with the groomsmen wearing kilts.\n\nThe coolest stop was the Falkirk Wheel. I told Rachael we were going to see a boat elevator but she didn't believe me, and even when we got there she was convinced it was a road with busses until we walked up and saw the water.\n\nEven when we saw it she still didn't really beleive it. We walked further upstream and saw some loch's fill and float boats up which helped it make a bit more sense.\n\nThis video is a pretty good explanation:\n\nWhen we passed through Glasgow earlier it felt like Queen St in Brisbane, and driving in was even more like Brisbane and was like driving on the ICB. It must just have a similar architecture or something.\nWe went to Pollok House and Garden while we waited for our check-in time and to meet up with Katherine and co. There was some really nice gardens and was a good free place to visit. They even had free parking which wasn't the case at any of the other stops that day.\n\n\nWe met up with Katherine, Tom and his brother Liam. We went to an awesome vegetarian Indian place for dinner that was super cheap and tasty - and very busy and booked out so we had to get takeaway.\nIt was great having someone else organizing our day, and Katherine had planned out heaps of places for us to stop. First up was Devil Paulpit which she found from some blog about outlander. Was super hard to find, and then even harder to work out how to get down but was an incredible stop. There was no signage and only a few other people which is crazy because it's such a cool little spot.\n\n\n\n\nWe found an abandoned castle behind a gold course, Buchanan Castle.\n\nNext up we went to Loch Lomond and climbed Conic Hill.\nWas a nice little hike but when we got to the top the winds were just crazy, like mildly-cylonic strong.\nIt had great views of the lake, and the surrounding green hills.\n\n\nWe then checked out Bracklinn Falls, which was a nice waterfall and wooden bridge.\n\n\nThat night we were staying at a castle Katherine found on AirBnB, which had fields with lambs and pheasants.\n\n\nThe next day we drove to Perth, where there was a lake good for wildlife watching. But it was mostly just bird watching, cost money and didn't look that exciting. So we just went for a walk instead, we saw a deer and some red squirrels.\n\n\nAbout lunchtime we said goodbye to Katherine, Tom and Liam and started south on the motorway to England while they headed up to the highlands.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/glasgow/","title":"Glasgow"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/hot-100-votes-2016/":{"body":"\nVotes:\n\nMontaigne - Because I Love You\nMilky Chance - Cocoon\nTash Sultana - Jungle\nBig Scary - The Opposite Of Us\nAnne-Marie - Listen To Soul, Listen To Blues {triple j Like A Version 2016}\nMiike Snow - Genghis Khan\nLuke Million - Stranger Things Theme\nHoly Holy - Darwinism\nTemper Trap, The - Fall Together\nKing Gizzard &amp; The Lizard Wizard - Gamma Knife\n\nShortlist:\n\nAmy Shark - Adore\nBall Park Music - Nihilist Party Anthem\nBall Park Music - Whipping Boy\nBirds Of Tokyo - Brace\nFlume - Never Be Like You (feat.

The bus trip was pretty unreal, it was just a dead straight well-maintained highway with no trees and barely any other cars. Once you get closer to ReykjavÃ­k there starts to be buildings and trees, but the first part is just the middle of nowhere.\nWe stayed at KEX Hostel, which has a cool bar area and there was band playing when we arrived. The food in Iceland is crazy expensive and so we just bought some snacks for dinner at an expensive convenience store. We booked a Golden Circle bus tour for the next day.\nFirst stop on the tour was Ãingvellir where you can see the tectonic places. It wasn't much of a tour as they didn't tell you that much, pretty much dropped you off and said be back on the bus in an hour (they did give a tiny bit of backstory on the drive to each stop). It was a pretty cool area but was freezing cold and starting to rain. It's a rift valley and you can see where the tectonic plates have been pushed up out of the ground. Some scenes from Game of Thrones were filmed there also.\n\n\nThe next stop was Gullfloss Waterfall which reminded me of\nRheinfall in Switzerland. The weather was absolutely terrible, with icy cold wind and rain. So we had a very quick look then went into the restaurant, and got what was probably the most expensive toasted ham and cheese sandwich in the world. After warming up we went out again for another quick look. If the weather had been better I'm sure I would have enjoyed it a lot more.\n\n\nFor the last stop on the \"circle\", we went to see Geysir which is the geyser that geysers are named after. We didn't see Geysir errupt, but the Strokkur geysir errupted pretty regularly. There was also a couple of small one's that bubbled away that were cool. The whole place smelled of sulphur of course, and it was still raining off and on and freezing cold. Again, would have been much better if the weather was better, although it did start to clear up a bit at the end before we had to leave.\n\n\n\nOf course once we had seen all the main sites, the sun came out and the weather became lovely. Pretty annoying, but it did make for an epic bus trip back and the views were incredible (couldn't see anything on the way there really due to the rain). We also stopped at an earthquake exhibit at a Shopping Centre in HveragerÃ°i which was pretty cool, the ground had literally split in half at the shopping centre in 2008, so they made a tourist attraction out of it. It also gave us a chance to buy some food at a supermarket as they have really short opening hours in Iceland and would have been closed by the time we got back.\nOnce we got back to ReykjavÃ­k we went for a walk around the city and went to the see the church on the top of the hill (HallgrÃ­mskirkja).\n\n\nWe found a place that had hot soup noodles for dinner, they didn't have any tables free, so we got takeaway and ate them on the oceanfront. Was still pretty cold, but was nice with the sky cleared up and the noodles were boiling hot and tasty.\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/iceland-golden-circle/","title":"Iceland Golden Circle"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/iceland-silfra/":{"body":"Monday we had much nicer weather, and it was the day Rachael was most looking forward to. I showed her this Smarter Everyday Video when we were planning our trip and since then snorkeling at Silfra was what she was most looking forward to.\nIt's actually part of the Ãingvellir fields, so we got the bus back again. The drive and views were so much better with the sun out. We then put on our drysuits, which were pretty much like putting on a wetsuit. Rachael really struggled to get hers on, but she hadn't used a wetsuit before either. The water actually felt really warm when you got in, the suits do an amazing job of keeping the water out (one guy in our group didn't have a good seal and got a bit wet and had to go back to fix it though). We also bumped into Lauren and her work friends, who were diving after us.\n\n\nThe snorkel was incredible, the water was incredibly clear and there was a slight current from the glacial melt that pushed you along. The water was the most vivid blue, and you could see tiny algae floating in the water.\nTowards the end the cold really started to seep in, my feet, hands and face eventually went numb from the cold.\nAt the end of the snorkel was a small open sandy bit with ducks swimming around with us.\n\n\n\nIt hurt to walk back to the car park because my toes felt like they were about to fall off.\nWe got a joint package to also go see a lava cave. We weren't expecting much I thought it would be a bit touristy, but it was in the middle of nowhere at Lavacave LeiÄarendi. Even from above the cave was incredible views, just lava as far as you could see in one direction and snow capped mountains behind us in the other.\n\nThe cave tour was more adventurous then I was expecting too, with some narrow places where you had to crawl.\nAt one point Rachael thought she saw a finger and freaked out, but it was just a rock. The tour guide said that she  will now be part of the stories that he tells other visitors. We turned off all our lights at one point to experience the absolute darkness which was also a cool experience. There was also heaps of giant icicles.\n\n\n\nSo far we had an absolutely incredible day, and I looked up the aurora forecast which said there would be activity that night so we booked a Northern Lights tour as well. The tour itself was a bit of a rort, the bus picked us up at 7 and then we waited just 5mins down the road for about an hour for it to get dark. They then took us about 20mins out of town but there was still a fair bit of light pollution.\nIssues with the tour didn't matter too much because as soon as you hopped off the bus, you could see the lights faintly. Because you can't see colours well at night, they don't look like the photos. It just looked like a normal thin greyish cloud, but the way it danced across the sky was what made it impressive. I got a photo on my phone that captured pretty well what it looked like to the naked eye. It's actually one time where it's better to look through your camera...\n\nAt one point early on, it came over really bright and vivid for about 60 seconds. I could actually make out pink and green colours and the way it moved across the sky looked incredible. It was extremely impressive and the guide so it was the best that it had been in about a month. It wasn't as good for the rest of the night but still visible.\nSince Lauren was also in Iceland that night, they text us to say they could see it from the hottub of their AirBnB. If we'd had a car we would have gone further from the city and it would have been way better, but we were still pretty lucky to see it as good as we did in the short time we had in the country.\nI got some better photos with the camera using a long exposure (didn't have a tripod so not great).\n\nWas an excellent day, probably the best of our trip.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/iceland-silfra/","title":"Iceland Silfra and Northern Lights"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/iceland/":{"body":"For our last day in Iceland we went to the Blue Lagoon Geothermal Spa. It stinks of sulphur as you come in but you get used to it after a bit. I wasn't expecting to like it that much as it's more Rachael's thing, but was pretty fun.\nThey had a steam bath which was intense as you walk in as it's dark and the steam is so thick you can hardly breathe. It was pretty overwhelming so we didn't like it, but I tried it again later and it was more enjoyable. It was nice standing out in the freezing cold breeze and then going in. The main reason I liked it though was that it was in the middle of the lava fields so was a nice view from the pool.\n\n\nThe spa is actually next to a geothermal power station, which was cool to see with steam just pouring out of it.\n\nIn the afternoon, we just walked around the city. There was some nice parks and a lake.\n\nWe went to a place for dinner that had hot soups in a cob loaf, and it was delicious.\n\nAnd that night, there was a jazz band at the hostel who were pretty good.

On the way we saw a sign to something called Castlerigg Stone Circle, which we went through a extremely tight lane (barely fit one car) to get to.\nWas a nice little spot like Stonehenge (and free with no other people).\n\n\nWe drove along the Lake trying to find somewhere to stop, but there wasn't parking anywhere.\n\nWe drove through Honister Pass which had crazy views in the valley, but again was single lane and nowhere to stop.\nOnce through the pass we thought we might as well go see the west coast, and went to St Bees Beach but we couldn't find anywhere that sold fish and chips and the tide was way out. We stopped for chips at Ulverston, but it wasn't a very interesting town, and we couldn't even find anywhere to sit and eat lunch.\nWe then drove through another scenic pass back inland.\nIt was basically a full day of driving, straight past Manchester and Liverpool on our way to our next stop, which was Bala in Wales.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/lakes-district/","title":"Lakes District"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/leaving-london/":{"body":"\nWe went to Richmond Park in the morning, and the girls had breakfast at a cafe which was packed with cyclists.\nThe park was huge, and it was great weather so we went for a walk. We'd heard there was deer but it's a huge park and we couldn't see any. So we went for a drive to look at the lake in the middle and the deer just happened to be there. They were pretty passive compared to the few other deer I have seen in the wild, so must be pretty used to people.\n\nWe were a little bit rushed for time, as we were flying to Iceland that afternoon so went back to Lauren's for lunch.\nLauren let us know that she thought daylight savings was coming in that day, so we checked to make sure we weren't going to be an hour late for our flight, but it actually changed 3am the following morning. Daylight savings is a stupid system, I don't get why people like it.\nWe got a bus to Clapham Junction, and got our first normal train to Gatwick airport.\nThe flight was actually really cool, I had a window seat and we got to see some cool cities from above.\nFlying over Scotland and Isle of Skye was also cool, we could see all the rolling hills of the highlands, some of  which still had snow on them.\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/leaving-london/","title":"Leaving London"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/ljubljana/":{"body":"\nWe just visited Ljublana as a stopover on our way to Bled, but it ended up being a super pretty city with nice canals and streets.

Then walked back down and just walked around the old town and canals.\nFor dinner we had a really nice blue vein cheese pizza out the front of the canal.\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/ljubljana/","title":"Ljubljana"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/more-london/":{"body":"\nAfter some sleep, we headed back out to explore some more of London.\nThe beautiful weather from the previous day had ended and we got some of the London weather we were expecting in the form of cold miserable light rain.\nFirst up we went to see Tower of London and Tower Bridge. We were planning to go inside but the tickets were about $50 AUD each, so we thought we'd find something a bit cheaper to do.\nI really wanted to go check out Greenwich, so we tried to get a boat up the River Thames, but we didn't have enough credit on our oyster cards and you couldn't top them up at the ferry terminal. So we got a train there instead. We quickly stopped by the Cutty Sark ship on the way also.\nIt was a beautiful area (despite the weather) and we really enjoyed the tour of the Royal Observatory. They had lots of old clock designs and talked about the history of improving navigation on the seas and ways to calculate latitude and longitude.\n\n\nFrom Greenwich we headed to Leicester Square and had a very rushed lunch at Chinatown before Rachael and I went to go see the Book of Mormon (which was awesome).\n\nAfter the show we had a look around some of the shops while we waited for Lauren to come meet us again, particularly cool was the Lego Store.\n\nWe noticed that there were a heap of choppers flying around so looked on the news that there had been an attack at Westminster (lucky for us that we had gone the day before).\n\nFor dinner we were meeting Rachael's cousin and his partner at The Alchemist in the City of London, which took a while to get to as the traffic was pretty crazy. It wasn't so bad for Rachael and I though as it gave us more time to sightsee on the bus. After dinner, we went up to the Sky Bar which had a free lift to the top and had great views of the city and a band.\n\n\nThe next day we went in for lunch at the Borough Markets, which was like any international food market, except with a few different ones to what we are used to in Australia (such as Ethopian).\nFrom here we made our way along the river towards Shakespeare's Globe, which wasn't super exciting from the outside. Along the way I thought the ruins of Winchester Palace were pretty cool.\n\n\nWe came across the TATE modern art museum, which was full of weird modern art. GOMA in Brisbane is\nway better in my opinion. There was a nice view from the top of the building though.\n\nThat afternoon we just chilled at Lauren's and then went to one of her local pubs the Crab Tree. There was an open mic night with a few good bands, although I didn't think food was very good. They also had posters for a boat race the next weekend between Oxford and Cambridge which apparently is a big deal.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/more-london/","title":"More London"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/munich/":{"body":"We arrived and it was raining, so we quickly dropped out bags at the hostel and went to get lunch. We went to Augustine Keller and got pork knuckle since I had it last time I was in Munich and thought it was great. It was super fatty and wasn't as nice as last time, which I expect was mostly because I wasn't massively hungover from Oktoberfest. Rachael loved the building though and her spinach and mountain cheese soup.\n\nWe quickly visited Marienplatz and then back to hostel to check in. Next we went to Theresienwiese so I could show Rachael where Oktoberfest is held and the Bavaria statue. I had no idea you can go inside it (we didn't though) as I assume it was closed during Oktoberfest.\n\nNext I tried to show Rachael a recreation of the walking tour I did last time, which went okay except everything was closed for winter and it was raining. We went to see the May Pole but it was missing, and the churches were all closed for services. We went to Hofgarden, which would have been great if the weather was nicer.\n\nSomething that I really wished I'd seen last time was the Eisbachwelle surfing spot in the Englischer Garten, so we went there and despite Rachael saying nobody would be surfing in the freezing rain, there was heaps of people out. It was fun to watch, but eventually the cold rain got to use so we headed back to the hostel.\n\n\nWe got a free beer for checking in, it was massive!\n\nFor breakfast in the morning they coloured in the eggs though, which was cool. Also we ran into a girl in the lobby that Rachael and I both knew from Rocky who now lives in London.\n\nChurch bells rang like crazy the whole time we were there, was really strange as they weren't on the hour just at random times. Nearly all the shops were closed for Easter which combined with the cold rain meant the next day wasn't particularly great.\nWe walked in English garden in the morning but then it started to rain heavy again so we just hung out in the hostel lobby for the rest of the day.\nI walked to church during a break in the rain at lunch time, and managed to get in between services.\n\nNext we went to the bus station to wait for our overnight bus to Paris. We went to Vapianos for dinner, and had a really grumpy pizza maker and generally bad service compared to the one in Brisbane. We stayed there for a while as it was still pouring rain and freezing cold (I think it snowed later that night).\nOur bus ended up getting delayed several times, and they had terrible signage and changed which bay we were meant to wait at repeatedly. Then when the bus arrived no one seemed to have any idea about how to queue and just rushed onto the bus to get good seats. Since we waited to ask where to put out luggage we ended up having to split up. Eventually the guy next to Rachael got off at at one of the stops and so we were able to sleep. I was expecting a night bus to have much comfier seats that reclined (like the different set up for night trains), but no such luck - it was just a normal bus. After the airport in Berlin, we were left with the impression that while Germany has a good train system, bus stops and airports are terrible.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/munich/","title":"MÃ¼nchen"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/northern-ireland/":{"body":"So we picked up a car and headed north to drive along the coast, which was great.\nThere wasn't many cars and heaps of awesome scenery. We didn't go to the The Dark Hedges but saw some cool roads like it in the area.\nOur first tourist stop was Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge. The rope bridge itself was pretty tame and unexciting (the lady crossing behind us was freaking out), but the coastal scenery was pretty epic. The water was super clear and blue and we had great weather.\n\n\nNext stop was the Giant's Causeway which was also great. The rocks reminded me of the rocks along the Tabletop Mountain hike back home. The name seemed a bit silly at first as I couldn't really picture how it was a causeway but we hiked up the hill at the end and it did look like a caved in bridge across the channel.\nApparently there is a similar site on the other side in Scotland, formed when the islands were together millions of years ago.\n\n\nWe booked a random airBnB in the town of Sligo as it was on the way south.\nThe next drive was also incredible, especially the last bit with a big mountain shrouded in cloud.\nSligo town looked fun, we went in for a dinner at a pub recommended by our host, The Swagman. We were a bit slow in working out it was an Australian theme pub but eventually cottoned on to why the menu had so many foods we liked, and they had VB cans on the wall. I had a really tasty steak sandwhich.\nThe house we stayed at was beatiful and in a nice neighbourhood, we didn't actually want to leave the next morning and wished we weren't just passing through.\nMore driving south, this time through some lava fields called the Burren and some nice seaside towns.\n\nThe Cliffs of Moher were incredible. Reminded me of Jura in Switzerland but with ocean at the bottom.\n\n\n\n\nYou could leave the tourist centre and walk up further past farmland where there was no fence.\nIt was a really great walk and views, Rachael really didn't like that there was no fence though and kept freaking out it would give way.\nShe wouldn't even take a photo of me anywhere near the edge, but at least I didn't put my legs over it like some people.\n\n\nThen yet more driving, but this time we went on the highway rather then the scenic way which was a lot faster.\nWe stopped at a castle on the way but too expensive so didn't go in.\n\nWe drove through Limerick and there was a soccer game on, so there was lots of traffic and people out.\nDespite the amount of driving we did, it's a pretty small country and before we knew it where at Dublin!\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/northern-ireland/","title":"Irish Coast"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/oxford/":{"body":"On way to Oxford we stopped at Stratford-upon-Avon and saw the church with Shakespeare's grave while we stopped for lunch.\nThere was a nice canal but that's about it.\n\nWe were staying on the outskirts of Oxford so it would be easier to drive in and out, but the area wasn't all that nice and there weren't many places to eat.\nThe next day we got the bus into the center, and went to Blackwell's Bookshop while we waited for a tour.\nIt was really cool and had heaps of books. Upstairs was fiction, but they had heaps of non-fiction books downstairs in the Norrington Room that looked interesting.\nOur tour guide was an ex-student and reminded us of Jack Whitehall. There was a graduation on with them all in their gowns, which they also have to wear to exams. We learnt how the colleges were established to separate the students from the townsfolk, as they didn't get along well and had a habit of stabbing each other\nWe really wanted to go in the Bodleian Library but it is closed on graduation days. There is a section filmed for the restricted section in harry potter, that is actually restricted as it has lots of old books. It's also a legal deposit library so they get a copy of every book published in the UK and have over 12 million books. It's actually so big it's 5 different buildings, with tunnels and conveyer belts underneath where they can send books between them.\n\nNear the Radcliffe Camera our guide pointed out some things that potentially inspired Tolkien and C. S. Lewis who lived there, like this door that has a lion engraving that allegedly inspired the door for the Chronicles of Narnia.\n\nWe saw a pub full of cut off neck ties, and had a pub pointed out where Bob Hawke broke the world record for sculling beer.\nWe saw Einstein's Blackboard in the science museum.\nWe got some Burritos for lunch around the corner from Gropecunt Lane.\nWe couldn't get into the main library, but there was a small section in the Weston Library we went to which had original Tolkien Christmas letter which was cool to see something actually written by Tolkein but also funny because I'd never head of them before and they reminded me of the notes mum used to write for Sarah as Santa. They had some other rare books on display, like this tiny one.\n\nWe also went to the Pitt Rivers Museum, and saw some shrunken human heads as well as a really long skull.\n\nWe were going to go to the botanical gardens but they cost money, so instead we just walked along the river and saw all the rowing teams. There was also people on boats they pushed against the ground with poles.\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/oxford/","title":"Oxford"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/paris/":{"body":"After very little sleep on the bus, and leaving over an hour late, it meant we arrived late in Paris and so hit peak hour traffic, making us later still and stuck in traffic at a crawl. The bus actually went near our hostel and then we spent probably an hour in traffic after that getting to the bus stop on the other side of the city.\nThe bus depot itself was pretty terrible, essentially a giant car park near a metro station. Luckily we finished there and didn't wait there as there was no toilets, no cover and no food. We got a train to the hostel to find out they actually charge by the hour for luggage storage. So we had planned to go into the city but instead paid for a couple of hours and went to get food until we could check-in.\n\nThe Hostel had a booking desk, and the lady told us we could buy skip the line tickets from her for much cheaper due to a special deal and it also included audio-guides. It seemed to be good to be true but she was adamant. Turns out she was full of shit though, as we got there and they said no we had to line up (which took 2 hours) and then it didn't even include an audioguide.\nIt was the same hostel we stayed at last time and we thought was great, except this time I have to give the opposite review. So at this point neither of us was in a particularly good mood, and Rachael was starting to get sick so was at a point where she just wanted to cancel the holiday and go home.\nEventually we made it to the front of the line though, and the catacombs themselves were incredible and worth the wait. The first part was just miners tunnels which were pretty cool, but not what we waited 2 hours to see. And then you get to the bones, of which there was a mind-blowing amount and the tunnels just kept on going. It was hard to fathom that they were all people once and the sheer number of bodies dumped down there.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were in a much better mood when we came out, and then went to visit the Luxembourg Gardens.\n\n\nThe next morning we went to the ChÃ¢teau de Versailles. Which we got there early but was still packed with tourists, which despite this was also incredible. It was like the Vatican with the amazing paintings on every surface except even grander. Unfortunately lots of the palace was closed for renovations which was annoying because it didn't say this anywhere when we booked the tickets or even the tourist information they gave out once you got in. The audio guide would say to go one way and then someone would say sorry you can't go down there it's closed.\n\n\nIt was also interesting to see what was considered valuable then, as the grandest part was the Hall of Mirrors which at the time showed incredible wealth as most people could not afford a mirror, let alone an entire hallway of them.\n\nOnce you get out of the palace itself, it was time to visit the gardens. They are also incredible in their scale, better then any other gardens we have been to and the fountains were all turned off that day, so I imagine it's even better when they are on.\n\n\nThere was another whole grounds in the Marie Antoinette garden, which was probably the highlight as there were heaps of different paths and styles and we probably didn't even see a quarter of the grounds.\nAnd finally we headed back into the city, and had some delicious Sri Lankan for dinner.\nThe next morning Rachael was sick, so I went out myself to the see La Basilique du SacrÃ© CÅur de Montmartre which has a great view of the city. I got there pretty early and there wasn't many people around, just scam artists and some guy that wanted to sell me weed. It had a nice view but couldn't really see any landmarks, and could only just see Eiffel Tower if you looked at the right angle. The church itself was pretty impressive.\n\n\nLast time we stayed in Paris we thought it was great and wanted to stay longer, but this time we were mostly glad to leave. We were glad we came back for a second visit though, as the Catacombs and Versailles where well worth it.\nThe airport seemed to have changed a lot since last time we were there, and was a much better experience then last time. It was a nice quick flight and crazy how small the English channel is from the air. Was cool seeing Dover after being there could just make out the white cliffs and the harbour and ships.\nParis seemed dirtier and not as nice as last time.\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/paris/","title":"Paris and Versailles"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/salzburg/":{"body":"\nI left my Kindle on the train when we arrived in Salzburg which was a bummer, and the first thing we lost for the trip.\nThe old town was pretty, but outside of the old town wasn't very exciting. One thing we noticed was just how fast the water in the river was flowing, and the hugh amounts of water pouring in from the various little storm water outlets.\nThere were lots of references to Mozart, for example his house/museum/your local SPAR supermarket.\n\nIt was actually interesting how standard the shops were but they were done up to look authentic, like on Getreidegasse the McDonalds had a really old style golden arch sign that was in the same style as the rest of the shops in the street. There was also lots of little cool side alleys everywhere, and it is a stark contrast being in a city that was designed for pedestrians well before the invention of cars.\nWe went to the Festung Hohensalzburg (Fortress) for a concert but the ticket included looking around before hand. It had really nice views of the city.\n\nWe then saw a Mozart concert which was really good, but I didn't recognise as many of the songs as I was expecting to. You could tell they were very talented musicians as it looked very technically difficult.\n\nThe next day went for walk through Mirabell Palace Gardens, which were really nice. The actual palace was closed though.\n\n\nMost of the churches were closed for Easter services, but we did go in one really cool one.\n\nThere was another one with a graveyard out the back, which also had buildings carved into the cliff-side.\n\nWe walked up on ridge and found a nice grassy that looked out over the Alps was nice. You could faintly make out a gondola going up and down the mountain.\n\nUnfortunately most things were shut while we were there but we still enjoyed out time. We had really nice Indian for dinner.\nThe next day we had a lazy morning as it was raining, and then got a ticket on the next train to Munich (which was a massive wait of 4 minutes).\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/salzburg/","title":"Salzburg"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/snowdonia/":{"body":"We booked a farmhouse on AirBnB which was really hard to find and Rachael was a bit freaked out when we got there because it was in the middle of nowhere and there wasn't anybody home. But the owners showed up a bit later and were really nice, and put on an amazing breakfast.\nThe next morning we went for a hike. To hike Mt Snowden you need to get there extremely early to get a car park, so we did the less popular Crimpiau one instead. There was a free car park at the start next to a waterfall.\nIt's through farm land so there were heaps of sheep and lamb at the start. Also lots of stiles and ladders to cross fences.\n\n\nThe start was a nice woodland area, and then it got more open.\n\nAbout half way up there was a really nice view of a lake on the other side.\n\nWas super windy at the top, but not as bad as Scotland. We could hear jets flying over which echoed across the whole valley, although we couldn't see them.\n\n\nRachael was saying how great it was to be able to go on a hike without worrying about snakes and spiders, and about 5 minutes later she freaked out when I nearly stood on a small bright orange snake. I didn't see it until it was slithering away, but it was really pretty.\nThe path then went through a bog. I never really knew what a bog was and thought it was like a wetland.\nThe ground looked like solid dry grass, but when you step on it you sink slightly and your shoe fills with water. Not very pleasant but was a bit trippy at first so cool in that sense.\n\nAfter out hike, we drove past the base of the Snowden walk, and even the drive up was crazy high. Rachael didn't like driving near a shear drop, and it was a bit like driving to the ski fields in New Zealand. The car park was packed so we are glad we did the other hike. There was a cool quarry at the bottom on the other side as well.\nSince the distances are so small, we drove a bit further to the beach and actually found a proper fish and chips shop this time.\nIt was actually a nice little beach besides the rocks.\n\n\nThere was also a hillfort which had a nice view.\n\nWe drove bank to Bala lake as we didn't get a chance to see it the day before.\n\nOn our last night, the pig at the farm gave birth to piglets.

We then went for a walk around the old town which was full of pretty buildings. We visited\na free medieval museum which was on a little island next to the Royal Palace. Was a really cool area and the museum was pretty interesting. The old town itself was nice to just walk around.\n\nWe left early the next morning to walk to Skansen, after picking up some awesome pastry for breakfast from Coop.\nSkansen is an open air museum and zoo, but since it was still cold most things were closed and the animals were hibernating or not around. We did see some reindeer and wolves, and there was great views from the hill, but overall we weren't super impressed.\n\n\n\nNext to Skansen there was a really cool looking biological museum. We thought it was part of the Skansen ticket, but it wasn't and was pretty expensive admission. The guy on the door gave us a discount though, and it had a really cool double helix staircase.  The exhibit was mostly unchanged in 100 years, and while it wasn't that impressive after being to the natural history museum in London, at the time it was built it must have seemed incredible.\n\n\n\nFinally we went to the Vasa Museum, which was definitely the highlight of Stockholm for us. The Vasa was a massive warship that sank on it's maiden voyage. They recently pulled it out of the water and restored it, and built a giant museum around it. The museum has so much more to offer then I was expecting, for example they have a floor where they have the skeletons of the crew that died when it sank, along with their belongings and clothes, which allowed them to learn a huge amount of detail about how people lived during that time period.\n\n\nAfter the Vasa Museum, we were starving and walked into the city to get a late lunch. We were going to look around, but it started raining, so we got the train back to the accommodation.

We met Johan at Guttenberg then went to meatball house, and got some Swedish meatballs which were delicious.\nFrom here Johan drove us to his new apartment in Varberg. It was a really nice place, and the area really reminded me of Turgi. We went to the grocery store and bottle-o, interestingly Johan said that alcohol over 3.5% can only be sold at a government run store, where we bought some really nice Swedish wheat beer.\nIt was Johan's birthday, so went out to a nice Indian place for dinner.  Johan's place even had ocean views.\n\nThe next morning was really foggy, so we thought it would be a good time to go back into Guttenberg and visit Universium. It was a science museum but also had a cool rainforest and aquarium. It also had a cool space section where they had scales that had your weight on different planets.\n\n\nOn the way back we stopped at an English-Style castle called TjolÃ¶holms slott.\n\n\nThe next day we went to see the Varberg Fortress, there was also a really interesting looking swimming pool structure at the beach. They had photos of people swimming in the middle of winter when the ocean is frozen, but the water looked nice the day we were there (it was still way too cold though).\n\n\nWe went to meet Johan's parents and had a lovely home cooked meal. They also lived near a really nice beach, I wasn't expecting Sweden to have nice beaches.\n\nFinally, we went for a drive inland and went for a walk along some of the lakes.\n\nJohan was an excellent host, and we had an amazing time in Sweden. It wasn't what I was expecting at all and was also great having a local experience. We learnt lots and found out heaps of interesting things you wouldn't normally, like the fact that Denmark is so close that the TV could pick up both Swedish and Danish channels, and that they have a self serve checkout system over there where you get a handheld scanner to take with you and scan the items as you shop.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/vargberg/","title":"Varberg"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2018/":{"body":"","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2018/","title":"2018"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2018/hot-100-votes-2017/":{"body":"\nVotes:\n\nAlex Lahey - Every Day's The Weekend\nBusby Marou - Best Part of Me\nGang Of Youths - Let Me Down Easy\nHAIM - Want You Back\nMeg Mac - Ride It\nVance Joy - Lay It On Me\nMilky Chance - Blossom\nKingswood - Golden\nMethyl Ethel - Ubu\nTimberwolf - Ãkaros\n\nAlmost made it:\n\nVera Blue - Regular Touch\nAmy Shark - Weekend\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2018/hot-100-votes-2017/","title":"Hottest 100 Votes for 2017"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2018/lower-gorge/":{"body":"The actual hikes are all a single path that follows the creek, with a bunch of side paths.\nIt's recommend to go to the end first but as we were going with Rachael's dad Mark,\nwe did them in the order we came across them and aimed to do the main 4 in the lower gorge.\n\n\nThe first side track is for Moss Garden.\nThe water seeps through the sandstone gorge over thousands of years and then hits the basalt layer where it is forced outwards.\nThis means that the creek has water year round and there is a bunch of moss on the rocks.\n\n\n\nAmpitheatre was probably the best side track.

Unfortunately there is no way to get access to the data from it directly, so you can't really use it to do home automation or anything useful in real-time.\nYou can request your interval data from Ergon or Energex up to 4 times a year. This allows you to do some analysis and charting of your energy usage at least. Here is a link to my data for the 2017-18 financial year with my NMI redacted.\nWhen you look at daily consumption it's suprisingly easy to tell when we were away on holidays. We went to Rocky four times in the first half of 2018 and it's really easy to make these longer dips in energy usage out. There are a few shorter dips that represent weekend trips to Brisbane or the coast. You can also pick out really hot or cold days which have large spikes from the air-con.\n\nIt's even more apparent when you zoom in on the energy usage of a day when were away.\n\nIt's basically no usage except for the refrigerator compressor kicking in every now and then. Compare this to a cold workday where you can see a big spike when the heater was running before work and then afternoon usage when we got home from work.\n\nIt wasn't a particularly hot year in Toowoomba, so our average profile had a clear winter morning peak and then generally consistent afternoon peak throughout the year.\n\nSince Rachael was working a rotating roster there wasn't a huge difference between weekends/weekdays either.\n\nIt was also interesting to compare what we would have paid on different tariffs over the year. Since we have gas hot water we don't actually use that much energy and so discounts on the kwh rate didn't make a huge difference. The price was mostly driven by the daily charges that you pay no matter what. I was suprised that Tariff 12 (Time of Use) was slightly cheaper, but saving $13 a year is probably not worth having to worry about what time of day we use energy.\n\nThe SEQ retailers also seemed to be way more expensive, although that doesn't factor in the discounts and sign-up bonuses they offer.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2019/energy-data/","title":"Energy Consumption Data"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2019/eungella/":{"body":"We wanted to go snorkelling at Port Douglas, so decided to make a road trip of it so\nwe could visit family in Rockhampton on the way up.

So we made sure we stopped in on our way past this time. Everything was super green - not surprising after the floods.\n\nLittle Crystal Creek was an awesome little spot. The water was a bit cool, but a great little swimming hole. The waterfall was suprisingly strong and hard to swim over to due to the current flowing away from it.\n\nWe went to Big Crystal Creek and the waterhole was definitely bigger, but not as nice and a bit stagnant looking in parts.\n\n\nWe did see a sign for something further up called Rockslides and decided to give it a quick look, and it turned out to be the best swimming spot of them all.\n\n\n\nWe stopped in Ingham for lunch. The information centre was really good and looked out over the massive [Tyto Welands](Tyto Wetlands).\n\nFrom Ingham we went to visit Wallaman Falls - which after driving up the mountain you actually drive through a fair bit of rainforest. The road takes you to a lookout at the top of the falls.\n\n\nThe Djinda Hike was signed as pretty intense 2-3 hour hike up and back. So Rachael stayed up the top and read while I went down. About half way down it changes to rainforest due to all the mist that is thrown up from the waterfall into the valley.\n\n\n\nIt was super impressive and well worth the drive and hike up and down.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2019/paluma/","title":"Paluma and Wallaman Falls"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2019/port-douglas/":{"body":"We left Cairns super early to drive up to Port Douglas to do a sail to the Low Isles.\nThe sail out was pretty uneventful and the weather wasn't particularly great, it kept raining off and on.\nOnce we got to the island though we got to go snorkelling off the beach. We saw turtles and giant clams, so was pretty cool!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe did a tour of the island as well, which has a couple that live on it permanently that work for the BOM, and some housing for researchers.\n\nWe went back to the boat for lunch, and the water was a bit choppy so we had to go round to the other side of the island where it was more sheltered.\n\nIn the afternoon we went for another snorkle in more open water and saw even more turtles (about 3 at once) and a bunch more bigger fish.\nThere was a couple of reef sharks around and Rachael saw one between us and the boat when we were swimming back which she wasn't paricularly happy about (I swam over for a closer look). The water was absolutely teeming with tiny jellyfish. Some of them looked pretty cool but it was a bit worrying that some of them could have been Irukandji.\nThe sail back was super pleasant, and we were suprised to hear a cyclone was forming nearby.\nWe checked in to the resort that we were staying at - which had super nice walkways and trees. Was the first resort where part of check-in involves trying to sign you up to some sort of scammy timeshare seminar though.\n\n\nThe next day we were planning to go to Mossman Gorge and the Daintree but it was teeming rain when we got there, so we drove back into the centre of Port Douglas instead, where it also rained. Our sunset sail that afternoon got cancelled due to Cyclone Trevor also.\n\nSo we just pretty much stayed at the resort and read all day.\nThe resort was not very well designed for somewhere in the tropics where it rains all the time.\nEverything was flooded and most the walkways between building were not covered.\n\nOn the Wednesday we checked out super early and started heading back south to get away from the cyclone.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2019/port-douglas/","title":"Port Douglas"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2019/security-cameras/":{"body":"Uptype: post\ndate:  Ubiquiti have discontinued UniFi Video. The cameras from reolink seem to be basically the same, but cheaper. I'd probably get them instead. Very annoyed that they made it end-of-life just after I bought the NVR.\nRecently I ended up installing some IP security cameras at our place, and since a few people have asked about them I thought I'd do a quick summary on here.\nIt's something we talked about for a while, since we had an incident one holidays. Dad and I were doing work under the house, we all went to lunch and then when we came back we found a credit card under the house that wasn't there before. We took it to the police station and it turns out there had been someone running from the police that was hiding under our house while they were looking for him - and he must have dropped his credit card.\nWe also know of a few people that have been broken into recently, so thought it would be a good investment. QPS actually have a pretty cool interactive crime map.\n\nIt's also good to be able to check up on Mia - but Rachael finds it a bit depressing because she generally just waits for us at the back door and sooks until we get home. We did catch her opening a box to get her toys out - pretty clever.\n\nI ended up doing a bit of research because the requirements I had actually made it pretty hard to find cameras that did everything I wanted.\nThe Ring and Xiaomi looked okay - but recordings aren't stored locally so you need to pay for a cloud subscription to be able to record things. It also means that you use a bunch of data uploading the footage.\nIn order to record things locally you need something called Network Video Recorder (NVR) software. I ended up buying Ubiquiti cameras and they have free UniFi Video NVR software, but it only works with their cameras.\nI didn't want to be locked in to that though - you can also use something like ZoneMinder (free) or Blue Iris (paid) and they appear to support most IP cameras, although I haven't try either. The unifi cameras support streaming to other software - although you have to use their software first to enable this. Another requirement was that it had to work with Home Assistant, which the Unifi cameras do.\nI originally was running the free NVR software on my NAS, but it was a bit underspecced and made the NAS run slow and filled up the HDD. When the power went out the NAS wants you to check the disk before it starts it up again which also helpful for a security camera when you are away. So I ended up buying their hardware NVR to use instead.\nUptype: post\ndate: Annoyingly, they discontinued the NVR and replaced it with this a few months after I bought it.\nAnother requirement was that I preferrably wanted to use Power over Ethernet (PoE) which means you don't have to have a power point it just has an ethernet cable that powers it and does data transfer. But it meant I had to buy a new network switch that supports PoE as well and they are also expensive. You can just buy a standalone PoE injector for each camera ($10 each) but that makes things a bit messy as you would have a bunch of them and need a switch anyway if you don't have enough ethernet ports.\nIf you get the Flex model the cameras themselves weren't that expensive. I did get one of the more expensive models for the backyard beacause of the mounting design, but I don't think the quality is any better, even the night-time quality seems similar.\nIt ended up being a lot more expensive then I would have thought, but pretty happy with the setup overall now that everything is installed.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2019/security-cameras/","title":"Security Cameras"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2019/tcof-2019/":{"body":"This was the first year since we moved to Toowoomba where we haven't been to the wine festival, but we were still able to enjoy the gardens.\n\n\nMum and Dad brought my grandparents down this year to see the flowers (and Lyra).\n\nIt was 70 years of the Carnival this year, so that was the theme at Laurel Bank Park\n\n\nAnd we even managed to visit a few prize gardens.\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2019/tcof-2019/","title":"Toowoomba Carnival of Flowers 2019"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2019/tsrc/":{"body":"The TSRC opened on the Sunday with a marathon (there was a also a bike race and open day on the Saturday that Mark and Julie went to).

When we bought the air con for our living room it cost way more for the \"smart\" ones that you could control with your phone and we didn't think we would use it anyway, so we just got a dumb one. But since it can take up to five minutes or so before the heater works, it's definitely good to have it automatically turn on on cold mornings, or turn it on from your phone in bed.\nLuckily, since you turn it on with a remote, all you have to do is buy a universal remote with WiFi. I got the Broadlink RM2 Pro from eBay for about $40. The Logitech ones are probably much better, but cost way more.\nThere are also products like Sensibo that are designed just for air cons but are also way more expensive.\n\nThe app isn't very good and setting it up with home assistant is a little bit painful. You have to work out the code the remote sends to turn it on, which for our air con was:\n\nThe Broadlink Remote actually has a temperature sensor in it as well. So I set up an automation so that it will automatically turn on the air-con in the morning if the temperature is below 10Â°C.\n\nIt's been running nicely for a couple of years, but broke when I changed the WiFi a few months ago. It's been pretty cold the last 2 days so went through the painful process of re-pairing to the WiFi and it's all happy and working again now.

So many sayings and things from movies (flashback scenes) finally made sense, but I still thought I must be understanding something and that the minds-eye visualisation described was exaggerated. I was eventually able to get to sleep but first thing in the morning I made Rachael watch this video.\nSo turns out that Rachael can visalise things, but I can't. Which made perfect sense and explained so many things at the same time as completely blowing both our minds.\nI ended up reading a bunch of stuff online, like this post in which he can't even \"hear\" sounds in his head. This was actually pretty helpful as I can 'hear' sound in my head but cannot do the same thing with vision. It helped solidify that we were talking about the same thing when we meant you can 'see' things with your mind in the same way - and that I definitely can't.\nInterestingly he mentioned in that section that he does have an inner monologue but that the audio has no texture. But then last month this article did the rounds about some people not having inner monologues either. It seems like nothing about how our brain works can be taken for granted.\nThe next thing Rachael and I did was start asking everyone about whether they had Aphantasia or not. Dad has it, but no-one else in the family. Only one of the nurses at Rachael's work had it. A bunch of my engineering friends did have it. I wonder if there is a correlation with some professions, this article suggests 1 in 50 people have it. There is also a TED Talk about Aphantasia, which suggests that the concept is pretty new.\nShortly after this Lyra was born, and in the sleep deprivation of the first few weeks I realised that I could visualise things as I was drifting into sleep (and then woken up again). I couldn't really control what I was seeing though so Rachael quickly shot this down as just dreaming and not the same thing. I still can't do it while awake though and day-dreaming is such a crazy word to me now.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2020/aphantasia/","title":"Aphantasia"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2020/auburn-river/":{"body":"\nWe made a quick stop at Auburn River National Park on our drive to Rockhampton.\nWe started with the Gorge Top Walk which was not overly exciting but had a spectacular view at the lookout at the end.

There were a bunch of holes in the ground including an open pit that you could look down which was pretty cool.\n\n\nFrom here you can also see Castle Mountain Lookout, which we didn't attempt (as it's a 22km walk) but would be a good view if you had more time.\n\nAfter a quick look at the lake, we went back to the caravan park. Lyra really enjoyed the water park even though the water was still pretty cold. They had bird feeding every afternoon which was pretty hectic and meant that all the animals were pretty used to people.\n\n\n\nThe next day we did most of the hikes. Big Foot Walk is a really short one from the carpark, so we started with it.\n\nFrom there we climbed up to Giant's Chair Lookout, which is the opposite direction to what was recommended but Mark didn't want to do the full walk. It had nice views of the cliffs on the other side of the Gorge which we would hike in the afternoon.\n\nAfter the lookout it's a long, but mostly downhill, walk to see Fern Tree Pool and walk back through Doctor's Gully.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the main picnic area, Two Storey Cave Walk was another short walk we did before lunch. The 2nd \"Storey\" of the cave is home to some bats (which we didn't see but could smell).\n\nThe much more impressive part of that walk was the King Orchid Crevice, which was also covered in elkhorn ferns.\n\n\n\n\nAfter lunch we did The Dripping Rock and The Overhang Walk, which was definitely the highlight. It was pretty similar to Carnarvon - it even had aboriginal hand art. Everything was pretty green, but despite recent rain there wasn't much water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was another offshot to see Dragon Cave and Bloodwood Cave. Dragon Cave was pretty nice, but Bloodwood Cave wasn't particularly exciting. The bloodwood tree roots coming through the rock that it's named after were kind of impressive.\n\n\n\nFrom here you could also go up to another lookout before the start of the Castle Mountain Lookout walk. There had been some backburning or fire up the top but it still offered a nice view back towards the Giant's Chair Lookout that we had done in the morning.\nOverall, Cania wasn't as enjoyable as Carnarvon - but it's much easier to get to and still well worth a visit.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2020/cania-gorge/","title":"Cania Gorge"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2020/hot-100-votes-2019/":{"body":"\n\nAlex Lahey - I Don't Get Invited to Parties Anymore\nMethyl Ethel - Trip The Mains\nThe Chats - Pub Feed\nG Flip - Drink Too Much\nTame Impala - Borderline\nHoly Holy - Maybe You Know\nAli Barter - Ur A Piece Of Shit\nRuby Fields - Trouble\nKita Alexander - Between You &amp; I\nGeorge Alice - Circles\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2020/hot-100-votes-2019/","title":"Hottest 100 Votes for 2019"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2020/hot-100-votes-decade/":{"body":"\nLike always I limited it to one song per artist.\n\nBall Park Music - It's Nice To Be Alive (2011)\n\nI came close to going for Coming Down (2012) but went for the one more likely to get in the Top 10.\nThey had a bunch of songs from across the whole decade so hopefully they place highly.\n\nBluejuice - Act Yr Age (2011)\n\nBluejuice likewise had a bunch of hits I could have voted for, but chose this as the top pick.\n\nMatt Corby - Brother (2011)\n\nStill hasn't gotten old even after hearings lots of drunken renditions.\n\nHaim - Falling (2013)\n\nThe Wire is probably more likely to get in the list, but I like this one more.\n\n\nLorde - Royals (2013)\n\n\nThe Preatures - Is This How You Feel (2014)\n\n\nWas tossing up between this and a bunch of Saskwatch songs.\n\nTame Impala - The Less I Know The Better (2015)\n\nIn the yearly poll I struggled to decide between this and Let It Happen and was the same this time.\n\nMethyl Ethel - Ubu (2017)\n\nOnce I hear this song it gets stuck in my head for ages.\n\n\nAlex Lahey - I Haven't Been Taking Care Of Myself (2017)\n\n\nRuby Fields - Dinosaurs (2018)\n\n\nI didn't vote for this in the yearly poll but it has grown on me since.\nSome other songs that were on the short-list but not mentioned above:\n\nAdele - Someone Like You (2011)\nBusby Marou - Five Rocks (2010) or Underlying Message (2010)\nChildish Gambino - 3005 (2013) or Redbone (2016)\nFlorence + The Machine - Delilah (2015)\nGang of Youths - Let Me Down Easy (2017) or Magnolia (2015)\nJarryd James - Do You Remember (2015)\nKanye West - Runaway (2010)\nKing Gizzard &amp; The Lizard Wizard - Rattlesnake (2017)\nLittle Red - Rock It (2010)\nMarus Marr &amp; Chet Faker - The Trouble With Us (2015)\nVance Joy - Riptide (2013)\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2020/hot-100-votes-decade/","title":"Hottest 100 Votes for the Decade"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2020/house-design/":{"body":"Rachael had found an open house to inspect when Lyra was only 12 days old, after deciding our current house was too small now we had a baby. We couldn't find any existing houses on the market that were what we wanted, so we bought a block of land that came up at the end of last year, and we've spent most of this year finalising a design.\nOf the builders we visited, we couldn't find a house plan that was exactly what we wanted either, so we'd have to come up with our own. I found a free program online called Sweet Home 3D that made it quite easy to sketch things up and look at it in 3D with furniture. Although it's a bit fiddly and sometimes glitchy it worked pretty well for a free program. In order to learn the program, I drew up our current place. This also helped to get a feel for dimensions of rooms and what sizes we would want.\n\n\nOur new block is actually smaller then our new one. Our current block is only 14x56m (quite long and narrow) vs the new one at 20x30m. You lose at least 2m each side, 6m at the front, and about 8m out the back (due to steep drop off) which meant that our footprint couldn't exceed 16x16m. (Our existing house is about 6.2x14.9m)\nWe wanted a master, 2 kids bedrooms, a guest bedroom and a study (so 4-5 bedrooms all up). The amount of rooms we wanted and the fact that we wanted to make use of the view to the back of the block meant we needed to build two-storey (which costs more).\n\nWe wanted at least one room and bathroom on the ground floor so that if someone broke their leg or the grandparents were visiting it would be possible to access everything you needed without going upstairs, which also meant the kitchen had to be downstairs. The design we had in mind was actually similar to a display home we visited in Highfields, the Hotondo Jaxton, it was flipped a bit but pretty close.\n\n\n\nWe spent a few months trying to get a quote out of Hotondo (which we never got) but after getting rough quotes from other builders for similar designs worked out this was going to be more than our budget. That design was about 324m2 and we learned that they essentially quote $1200/m2 for 2-storey builds and so we needed to reduce the footprint size.\nSo we moved a bunch of things downstairs so that we could remove the 3rd bathroom, and make it so that only part of the house was two-storey in the hope that would make the build easier and cheaper.\n\n\n\nI still like the 2nd design but we decided it wouldn't work for small children as you don't want to have to go up and down the stairs at night every time they cry out. I struggled getting things to fit on our block neatly after moving the master downstairs. We considered going to see an architect for help, but eventually I was able to get something to fit that we were happy with.\n\n\n\nOur thinking was that this way their are two downstairs kids bedrooms for when they are young, with a guest and office upstairs, but that can be swapped for older kids if they want to move upstairs.\nFinally, the draftsman did the design up properly and made sure it all ligned up, and we made a few more tweaks. We now have something we are ready to build!\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2020/house-design/","title":"House Design"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2020/obituaries/":{"body":"2020 continues to be an eventful year, with both of my grandmas recently passing away less than a month apart.

I used the Ubiquity Design Center to work out Wifi AP placement.\n\nWe are running all the cables back to the cupboard next to the downstairs TV. Originally I was going to run it to the cupboard under the stairs but the builders thought they would need to add in a bulkhead across the hallway to do that.\n\nI also got them to put in a conduit (pipe) so that we can put HDMI /audio cables through to the TV later.\n\nIt will basically be impossible to add wiring in the downstairs ceiling after the fact, so the other thing I wanted to add was speaker cable in case we decide to put in surround sound. We got a quote for some good quality ceiling speakers but decided we'd just stick with the cabling for now and add them later if needed. With a baby in the house, we haven't been watching many movies lately anyway.\n\nUpdate:\nGetting 2 WiFi APs ended up being overkill, as whilst it does provide stronger reception, running the upstairs one by itself covers the whole house okay. The actual cabinet itself looks pretty good.\n\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2021/house-electrical/","title":"House Electrical"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2021/house-foundations/":{"body":"Before Christmas they started doing the earthworks and retaining wall at the back of the block.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also had to pick all our selections before Christmas.\nIt wasn't actually too bad as the interior designer had a showroom with most of the selections to choose from.

We had storms forecast this time as well, but we were able to get our tent up just before it rained.\nThe Cyliner Beach Campsite we stayed at was really good, was right on the beach and some local Kangaroos and Curlews.\n\n\nWe were camping just near Point Lookout and so we went toSouth Gorge Beach for a quick look before it rained. It is closed to swimmers despite the Surf Life Saving Club being on the hill above it. It was a really nice beach but there were definitely some strong currents and swimming would be a bad idea.\n\n\nThe next morning we went back to South Gorge. There is a walking track around to the Whale Rock Blowhole Lookout, it definitely did sound like a whale and a bit more impressive then what we called the Blowhole at Emu Park.\n\n\nFrom here we also saw a bunch of dolphins chasing a school of fish as well as a turle.\n\n\nThe walking circuit was closed to North Gorge, but you could still go back to the carpark and start at the other end for the first part of the walk.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the beaches looked really nice but were closed to swimmers due to the currents.\n\nIn the afternoon we went to Brown Lake. The brown colour reminded me of Water Park Creek near Rocky. There was a very cold breeze so we didn't stay in the water long.\n\n\nAt night we went looking for crabs.\n\nAnd then after good weather all day - finally got hit by a big storm once we'd gone to bed.\n\nCylinder Beach itself was also really nice. There was a little protected pool Lyra could wade in.\n\n\n\n\nThe tent was pretty soaked but at least it wasn't raining while we pulled it down. It started raining about 5 minutes after we finished.

It was a very nice, but short walk (which was perfect with the kids).\n\n\nAt Toogoom we stayed at a house right on the beach. The beach itself was okay at high tide but when the water went out it went out really fast and a long way. Even at high tide the water was very shallow - but again that was good for young kids.

We drove through Lithgow as the kids were asleep but it had a strange mix of nice old buildings and cottages juxtaposed with a big coal power station and coal terminal. Rachael was driving and freaked out a little when suddenly we went from a not so busy highway onto the\nPass of Victoria which is a super narrow highway with huge cliffs either side. The traffic was incredibly busy with huge trucks going both ways.\nWe checked-in to a hotel at Blackheath just off the highway, and spent a few hours waking up the (very grumpy) kids from their nap before backtracking to Mt Victoria. There was heaps of very loud cicadas pretty much everywhere in the Blue Mountains which I thought sounded really cool, but they bothered Lyra and Rachael.\nFirst stop was The Big Nugget Rock Lookout - it was just at the back of some houses and had some amazing views - but was very terrifying with 2 young kids as there was no railings and sheer drops.\n\nWe went to the nearby Mitchell Ridge Lookout where you could see all the trucks driving up the highway we drove in on. It was fenced so we were able to enjoy the views with a bit less anxiety except for when Felix wanted to lean and swing against the (quite old) wire fencing.\n  \nWe had got pizza for dinner and had it in a park in Blackheath which was a really little town.\nThe next morning we went to the playground at Blackheath Memorial Park which was quite nice (we saw lots of playgrounds this holidays). Once the kids had burnt off some energy we went Govetts Leap Lookout which was incredible and definitely exceeded our expectations.\n  \nWe did the short walk to the information centre and then tried to some of the Pulpit Rock track - which would have been good for the kids if Lyra was co-operating but she wasn't so we bailed and went back to the hotel. (Felix wasn't super keen about holding hands near the cliffs either)\n\nWhile the kids were having a break I went for a walk from the hotel to suss out Mermaid's Cave as we couldn't work out if the carpark was open or not (there was some roadworks but it was). You could walk there from the hotel although the track was pretty intense (not so bad since I was heading down into the valley but would have been the other way). Mermaid's Cave itself was great as it suddenly changed from warm to a nice cool rainforest.\n    \nThe was a shortcut hike from Mermaid's Cave to Centennial Glen, but it was incredibly difficult - very steep and slippery - would not recommend.\n \nThe Centennial Glen hike on the other hand was great - although no way I would have done it with the kids.\n          \nAll up I was back to town in under 2 hours and so swapped with Rachael and she explored the town and then did a little bit of the hike in reverse, making it to Fort Rock.\n \nWe then picked her up and did Mermaids Cave again this time with the kids.\n \nWe went to Campbell Rhododendron Gardens next.\n \nAnd finally we pushed the kids into doing one more thing for the day and went for a drive to Wind Eroded Cave Lookout and Perrys lookdown, which were both great.\n \nI went to Evans Lookout for Sunrise while everyone was still sleeping, which had incredible views and I a Lyrebird for the first time.\n\n \nI then quickly did the Walls Cave walk before heading back to grab the kids.\n     \nBefore leaving Blackheath we went back to Evan's Lookout with Rachael and the kids to see if the Lyrebird was still there, and there was 2 of them and a baby.\n \nOur next stop was Katoomba and Scenic World. The kids had been excited for this the last few days, but the animatronic dinosaurs proved a bit too realistic and we had a bit of a rough start as they were a bit scared.\n\nEventually we bought tickets and ended up doing the Skyway and Railway and everyone loved it, although Lyra and Rachael found the railway a bit scary.\n       \nThe lookout for the three sisters at Echo Point was also quite good.\n \nThe next morning I quickly did the Pool of Siloam &amp; Lyrebird Dell walks which were quite nice. Unfortunately a lot of the other hikes nearby like Leura Cascades were closed.\n   \nWe went to the lookout at Wentworth Falls with the kids and we saw a helicopter bringing in supplies for one of the walking tracks flying back and fourth across the valley - which was pretty fun to watch.\n\nAnd then quickly did the Lyrebird Dell with the kids as it was quite short (and Rachael got to do Pool of Siloam)\n\nOverall the Blue Mountains was excellent, and there was so much we didn't have time to do so I'd definitely be keen to come back when the kids are older and more willing to do hikes.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2024/blue-mountains/","title":"Blue Mountains"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2024/cargo-bike/":{"body":"We have now had our Cargo Ebike for a year, and so thought I'd write a review in the vein of the posts a colleageue Simon did [1] [2] [3].\n\nWith the kids getting bigger and Lyra no longer fitting in the bike trailer properly (not to mention it was hard work pulling 2 kids up hills) we wanted to look into getting an electic cargo bike to avoid needing to buy a 2nd car. Also putting the trailer on the bike (and taking it off) was a bit too involved to make it worth the effort for small trips like to daycare dropoff.\nAfter trying out Chase's Riese &amp; Muller Load4 with the kids, we were sold on the idea of a electric Cargo Bike, although a bit put off by the price and the fact that it takes up quite a bit of space in the garage (and too heavy to easily move around).\nWe ended up going with a Moustache Lundi 20.5 Belt Cargo EBike which was a fair bit cheaper (but still expensive!) and much easier to manouver and store.\nHaving the kids on the back also feels a lot more normal to ride, although it only took a few minutes to get used to the front loader when we tried it. The dual suspension on the more expensive one was nice too, the kids aren't a huge fan of bumps on the Moustache.\nI don't think I could ride the Load4 without assist, but the Lundi is actually not that bad to ride without assist (even with kids on the back) as long as you aren't going up a hill.\n\nWe managed 1,147 km over the first year, which is not a huge amount but still impressive.\nFor commuting to work I primarily still use my (human powered) mountain bike and Rachael uses the e-skooter, and the Moustache is mostly just for trips with either the kids on the back or for small grocery trips. So overall pretty happy with the amount of usage, it is equivalent to riding to Brisbane and back 4.5 times.\nThe range was advertised as 40-90 km with the single battery and that seemed pretty accurate. The 40 km is if you ride on Turbo mode but you probably can push to the 90 km riding on Eco mode. Assuming 50 km a charge, that's 23 charges over the year or 11.5 kWh. Since we charge off solar, that's a measly $1.26 to charge it for the whole year! Even assuming charging without solar it would only be about $3. The equivalent petrol in our ineffecient Vitara would be about 133 L or $265. That's not as much petrol savings as I was expecting, but once you factor in rego etc the bike will have paid for itself within 6 years (and we went for the more expensive belt model) which isn't bad.\nThe bike is also a lot more conventient and fun then driving for short trips (unless it's raining). We went to a few events in the city (TCOF parade, Anzac Day March etc) and you can ride straight into the city without having to worry about road closures or parking. Rachael often uses it to ride into the library as well where you can just park it out the front.\nAnother unexpected delight was looking at Christmas lights. In December we rode around looking at the houses with lights and it was much more enjoyable then doing it in a car where the kids can't really see out the window really well anyway.\n\nYou can also ride with an adult (up to 70kg) on the back by re-arranging the seats, and I doubled Rachael a few times to events where parking would be an issue like the Peak2Park fun run.\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2024/cargo-bike/","title":"Cargo Bike"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2024/coonabarabran/":{"body":"For our first day of our NSW road trip we wanted to get to Coonabarabran, which is a bit over 6 hours drive from Toowoomba. So we left early (we saw heaps of animals on the road  - kangaroos, wild pigs, even a fox) and timed it so we'd get there a bit before 7:00 for the Goondiwindi ParkRun.\nThe walk along the Macintyre River was really nice, and was a great spot to stop for breakfast and the first playground for the kids (of many).\n\nWe had planned to stop in Moree and maybe go to the Aquatic Centre, but the kids were asleep so we drove through to Narrabri where we stopped for lunch.\n\nLeaving Narrabri was saw our first few planets along the Virtual Solar System Drive - there will be more on these later. They weren't sign posted so we drove past Neptune as we weren't expecting it, but pulled over for Uranus. We completely missed Pluto earlier which obviously still counted as a planet when they built the models. The scale really is mind-boggling vast.\n\nWe pulled off the highway to see the\nPilliga Sandstone Caves. Confusingly there was no sign to turn off and it looked like some random forestry road, but the actual walk itself was great. We had a bit of a rough start putting on sunscreen and due to the heat - as well as instantly needing to find a toilet which did exist but was a little way into the walk and also not signed. But once we got to the actual caves the kids really enjoyed it and we saw a goanna at the end which they found exciting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was then just a short drive to Coonabarabran, with a quick stop to see Saturn.\n\nThe information centre was quite nice too, they had a bunch of free maps and a little museum.\n\n\nThe Warrumbungles is a Dark Sky Park which basically means super low light pollution. Our hotel even had signs saying to make sure you close the blinds at night so as not to ruin the experience - although super annoyingly the hotel had a giant spotlight running the first night which meant you couldn't see much at all. The second night they had it off at least and we could (just barely) see Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS with the naked eye, but pretty clearly with binoculars. The stars were probably on par with what we used to see at Emu Park as kids, although they might better in that National Park proper. I did try to take a long-exposure photo but without too much success.\n\nWe tried a few short hikes with the kids with some success - we had a few false starts and tantrums from Lyra but eventually managed to do the Wambelong Nature Walk and the short walk behind the information centre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe kids were pretty over it afterwards though so Rachael and I had to take it turns to see the Whitegum Lookout (even though it was only a super short walk) while the other stayed with the kids at the car (the first of many such times). Even the drive in and out of the park was quite nice though.\n\nWe then finished off the solar system drive, with the inner planets along the way up to \"the sun\" being the Siding Spring Observatory. There is a free little museum and cafe there and you can even go inside to the telescope. The views from the lookout there are pretty spectacular also.\n\n\n\n\nWe took the kids back for a nap, and Rachael stayed at the hotel while I went back and tried to sneak in one more hike.\nI was going to do the start of the Breadknife Hike which is meant to be one of the best walks in Australia but it said would take 5-6 hours and so I was just going to see how far I got in an hour and then turn around. Turns out the time estimate is very pessimistic so I ended up doing the whole thing in a bit under 3 hours. To be fair there were a lot of stairs and I was jogged several bits of it to make sure I didn't take too long.\n\nIt was crazy just how well built-up and maintained the track was - a lot of it was paved and not really what I would call a hike.\n\n\nThe bread-knife is pretty insane up close. Just a sheer cliff face which when you come around the corner later you realise is actually super thin.\n\n\n\nThe views at the top were incredible\n\n\nIt looked like they were doing some work to the path at the top of the cliff,with a helicopter dropping off bags of rocks up the top.\n\n\n\n\nThe walk is a loop, heading back down the other side of the mountain but the Western part was less maintained and the view not as great. I did see more animals on this side though - there was a even a bunch of wild goats in the National Park which was a little unexpected.\n\nThe next morning we had a quick walk along the creek (and used the playground) before leaving.\n\nWe did quickly stop at the\nCrystal Kingdom which was a shop with a gold-coin donation museum that was pretty cool.\n\nWe stopped for lunch at Mudgee which was a cool little town, and popped into a winery off the highway on the way out also.\n\n\nAfter a nice drive, Pearson's Lookout gave us our first view of the Blue Mountains.\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2024/coonabarabran/","title":"Coonabarabran & Warrumbungles"},"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2024/newcastle/":{"body":"We had a bit of a drive around Newcastle while the kids were asleep but spent most of the afternoon at the hotel as it had a pool.\nThe next morning we met up with Rachael's cousins at Merewether Beach, and I was suprised by how good the surf was and how nice the beaches were considering they are next to a large port.\n \n \n  \nIn the afternoon we went to the Blackbutt Nature Reserve which had a little free zoo.

In Bellingen we stopped at the Old Butter Factory Cafe which was good for the kids, and the drive itself was nice with everything being super green.\nAt the Dorrigo National Park Visitor Centre they had a short treetop walk platform.\n    \nThere was then a couple of short walks, and we even saw a snake (which kept Rachael paranoid for the rest of the day)\n  \nThe drive to Armidale had a bunch of short detours to waterfall lookouts which lucky for us were usually next to the carpark so we didn't have to drag the kids out of the car. Dangar Falls even had a playground next to the lookout which was very convenient!\n \nWe bypassed a few at the end to get to the hotel, we stayed at the Deer Park Motor Inn Armidale which had a herd you could feed in the afternoon.\n\nThe next morning we backtracked to a couple of falls we had missed and then had a look around Armidale itself.\n    \nThere was some markets in town for Halloween when we went back in for dinner.\n\nWe started our last drive back in the morning, driving through Guyra (which snows most years) and then Glen Innes. The Australian Standing Stones were worth stopping at.\n  \nFinally we went through Stanthorpe, stopping at a winery and Granite Belt Christmas Farm.\n\n","id":"https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2024/waterfall-way/","title":"Waterfall
