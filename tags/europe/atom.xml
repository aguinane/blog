        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/trip-end/">&lt;p&gt;We dropped the rental car of at Heathrow then got the train back into the city to Lauren&#x27;s.
After 2 months of travel it was good to just chill and watch TV at Lauren&#x27;s.
We went out for a sunday lunch at the pub with Rachael&#x27;s cousin as well, which was good but super expensive.
Stuff in London seems to cost about the same in pounds as it would at home in AUD.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;trip-end&#x2F;newmans.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we made nachos for lunch and lounged around, then at night rented some &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tfl.gov.uk&#x2F;modes&#x2F;cycling&#x2F;santander-cycles&quot;&gt;Borris Bikes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and rode into the city.
Matt recommended it to us as a great way to the see the city, and we started along the river and past Westminster.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;trip-end&#x2F;westminster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then rode up to China Town to get some food.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;trip-end&#x2F;chinatown.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then rode up the Mal and stopped at Buckinham Palace, which was pretty much deserted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;trip-end&#x2F;gate.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was a really good idea, and I highly recommend it. We still had time on our bike rental the next day, so we rode in to the city again on our way to see the Lion King. Really showed how close everything is together, and how inner city Lauren was living.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;trip-end&#x2F;albert.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;trip-end&#x2F;eye.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lion King was great, super creative costumes and even better then Book of Mormon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;trip-end&#x2F;lion-king1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;trip-end&#x2F;lion-king2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our last day Lauren was actually moving, so we helped her move into the new place.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first flight was pretty good, but we had a 9 hour layover in Bangkok, which is a pretty unexciting airport. We found a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;maps&#x2F;MN9TN6E45542&quot;&gt;lounge&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that you could pay to go in for 2 hours and have a shower, so that killed some time but it was a long wait.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;trip-end&#x2F;airport.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we made it home, swapping straight from Spring to Autumn.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/oxford/">&lt;p&gt;On way to Oxford we stopped at Stratford-upon-Avon and saw the church with Shakespeare&#x27;s grave while we stopped for lunch.
There was a nice canal but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;oxford&#x2F;shakespear.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were staying on the outskirts of Oxford so it would be easier to drive in and out, but the area wasn&amp;#39;t all that nice and there weren&amp;#39;t many places to eat.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we got the bus into the center, and went to Blackwell&amp;#39;s Bookshop while we waited for a tour.
It was really cool and had heaps of books. Upstairs was fiction, but they had heaps of non-fiction books downstairs in the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blackwell_UK#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Norrington_room.jpg&quot;&gt;Norrington Room&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that looked interesting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our tour guide was an ex-student and reminded us of Jack Whitehall. There was a graduation on with them all in their gowns, which they also have to wear to exams. We learnt how the colleges were established to separate the students from the townsfolk, as they didn&amp;#39;t get along well and had a habit of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;St_Scholastica_Day_riot&quot;&gt;stabbing each other&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really wanted to go in the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bodleian_Library&quot;&gt;Bodleian Library&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; but it is closed on graduation days. There is a section filmed for the restricted section in harry potter, that is actually restricted as it has lots of old books. It&amp;#39;s also a legal deposit library so they get a copy of every book published in the UK and have over 12 million books. It&amp;#39;s actually so big it&amp;#39;s 5 different buildings, with tunnels and conveyer belts underneath where they can send books between them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;oxford&#x2F;radcliff-camera.jpg&quot; title=&quot;The%20Radcliffe%20Camera&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the Radcliffe Camera our guide pointed out some things that potentially inspired Tolkien and C. S. Lewis who lived there, like this door that has a lion engraving that allegedly inspired the door for the Chronicles of Narnia.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;oxford&#x2F;narnia.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Aslan%20Door&quot; alt=&quot;narnia&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw a pub &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bear_Inn,_Oxford#Tie_collection&quot;&gt;full of cut off neck ties&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and had a pub pointed out where Bob Hawke broke the world record for sculling beer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Einstein&amp;#x27;s_Blackboard&quot;&gt;Einstein&amp;#39;s Blackboard&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in the science museum.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got some Burritos for lunch around the corner from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gropecunt_Lane&quot;&gt;Gropecunt Lane&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We couldn&amp;#39;t get into the main library, but there was a small section in the Weston Library we went to which had original &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Father_Christmas_Letters&quot;&gt;Tolkien Christmas letter&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which was cool to see something actually written by Tolkein but also funny because I&amp;#39;d never head of them before and they reminded me of the notes mum used to write for Sarah as Santa. They had some other rare books on display, like this tiny one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;oxford&#x2F;book.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also went to the Pitt Rivers Museum, and saw some shrunken human heads as well as a really long skull.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;oxford&#x2F;museum.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were going to go to the botanical gardens but they cost money, so instead we just walked along the river and saw all the rowing teams. There was also people on boats they pushed against the ground with poles.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;oxford&#x2F;rowing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/snowdonia/">&lt;p&gt;We booked a farmhouse on AirBnB which was really hard to find and Rachael was a bit freaked out when we got there because it was in the middle of nowhere and there wasn&#x27;t anybody home. But the owners showed up a bit later and were really nice, and put on an amazing breakfast.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we went for a hike. To hike Mt Snowden you need to get there extremely early to get a car park, so we did the less popular &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eryri-npa.gov.uk&#x2F;visiting&#x2F;walking&#x2F;mountain-walks&#x2F;crimpiau-capel-curig&quot;&gt;Crimpiau&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; one instead. There was a free car park at the start next to a waterfall.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s through farm land so there were heaps of sheep and lamb at the start. Also lots of stiles and ladders to cross fences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;snowdonia&#x2F;walk7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;snowdonia&#x2F;walk1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start was a nice woodland area, and then it got more open.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;snowdonia&#x2F;walk3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half way up there was a really nice view of a lake on the other side.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;snowdonia&#x2F;walk2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was super windy at the top, but not as bad as Scotland. We could hear jets flying over which echoed across the whole valley, although we couldn&amp;#39;t see them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;snowdonia&#x2F;walk4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;snowdonia&#x2F;walk5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachael was saying how great it was to be able to go on a hike without worrying about snakes and spiders, and about 5 minutes later she freaked out when I nearly stood on a small bright orange snake. I didn&amp;#39;t see it until it was slithering away, but it was really pretty.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path then went through a bog. I never really knew what a bog was and thought it was like a wetland.
The ground looked like solid dry grass, but when you step on it you sink slightly and your shoe fills with water. Not very pleasant but was a bit trippy at first so cool in that sense.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;snowdonia&#x2F;walk6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After out hike, we drove past the base of the Snowden walk, and even the drive up was crazy high. Rachael didn&amp;#39;t like driving near a shear drop, and it was a bit like driving to the ski fields in New Zealand. The car park was packed so we are glad we did the other hike. There was a cool quarry at the bottom on the other side as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the distances are so small, we drove a bit further to the beach and actually found a proper fish and chips shop this time.
It was actually a nice little beach besides the rocks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;snowdonia&#x2F;beach1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dinas_Dinlle&quot;&gt;hillfort&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which had a nice view.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;snowdonia&#x2F;beach3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drove bank to Bala lake as we didn&amp;#39;t get a chance to see it the day before.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;snowdonia&#x2F;lake.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our last night, the pig at the farm gave birth to piglets. And Rachael couldn&amp;#39;t leave without patting their lamb.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;snowdonia&#x2F;lambs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/lakes-district/">&lt;p&gt;After driving along the wall, we stopped at our next accommodation which was in Penrith.
We went to the lake in afternoon for dinner. The pubs would be nice in summer, with lots of outdoor beer gardens along the lake.
The lake itself was okay, nothing particularly exciting, although again would be packed in summer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;lakes-district&#x2F;lake.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Ullswater&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we drove back to the Lakes District. On the way we saw a sign to something called Castlerigg Stone Circle, which we went through a extremely tight lane (barely fit one car) to get to.
Was a nice little spot like Stonehenge (and free with no other people).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We drove along the Lake trying to find somewhere to stop, but there wasn&amp;#39;t parking anywhere.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;lakes-district&#x2F;bridge.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Ashness%20Bridge&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drove through Honister Pass which had crazy views in the valley, but again was single lane and nowhere to stop.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once through the pass we thought we might as well go see the west coast, and went to St Bees Beach but we couldn&amp;#39;t find anywhere that sold fish and chips and the tide was way out. We stopped for chips at Ulverston, but it wasn&amp;#39;t a very interesting town, and we couldn&amp;#39;t even find anywhere to sit and eat lunch.
We then drove through another scenic pass back inland.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was basically a full day of driving, straight past Manchester and Liverpool on our way to our next stop, which was Bala in Wales.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/alnwick/">&lt;p&gt;On our drive south we wanted to go to the beach. Rachael was navigating so took us to what looked like a sandy beach on the map but was actually Lindisfarne causeway, which was a massive salt pan at low tide. After looking it up we thought about driving across to Lindisfarne Castle but it was really foggy and we didn&#x27;t really know how fast the tides are so thought it was best not to in a rental car.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt really familiar though, and I realised it was &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vikings.wikia.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Raid_of_Lindisfarne&quot;&gt;the island from the second episode&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of the Vikings TV show which I had only just watched before leaving Australia. We drove to a beach a bit further south and tried to see Lindisfarne Castle from there, and could make it out but the weather was still really foggy so not very good views.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to the next beach south though and saw Bamburgh Castle, which was really impressive. The beach itself was actually surprisingly good compared to what I pictured for England. It kind of reminded me of Farnborough, but foggy and cold.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;alnwick&#x2F;beach.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;alnwick&#x2F;beach2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Bamburgh%20Castle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The little village our AirBnB was at was really nice, and there was a field of rapeseed (canola oil) across the road.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;alnwick&#x2F;rapeseed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked up the road to an indian place for dinner, and we were pretty much the only ones there (was a bit early) but was probably one of the best Indian restaurants we&amp;#39;ve been too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed at Alnwick because I saw the poison garden &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atlasobscura.com&#x2F;places&#x2F;alnwick-poison-gardens&quot;&gt;on atlas obscura&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and we thought it would be interesting, but it wasn&amp;#39;t actually that exciting. It was mostly just vegetables and spices, like Rosemary and Lavender which we have in our garden. They did have some interesting one&amp;#39;s like &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aconitum&quot;&gt;monkshood&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Atropa_belladonna&quot;&gt;deadly nightshade&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; but nothing was flowering at the time. They also grow drugs there, but they weren&amp;#39;t out while we were there as they keep them locked up most the year.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;alnwick&#x2F;poison.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Alnwick Garden&amp;#39;s themselves were pretty nice though. The highlight was a section with heaps of different water fountain designs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;alnwick&#x2F;fountain.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Scott did a video on it about a month after we were there:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;jGo9gYypQc8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The castle next door looked pretty cool also, although we didn&amp;#39;t go in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;alnwick&#x2F;alnwick-castle.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Alnwick%20Castle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Alnwick we were heading to the Lakes District on the other side of the country, but we wanted to drive along &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hadrian&amp;#x27;s_Wall&quot;&gt;Hadrian&amp;#39;s Wall&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It was a great drive in general, with lots of rolling green hills with sheep.
The wall was impressive in that something nearly 2000 years old is still there. We went to a museum showing some of the roman history although we could have just done free stuff they implied you had to pay to walk up to the wall (which you don&amp;#39;t for most of it).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;alnwick&#x2F;wall1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latrine was most impressive showing they had plumbing back then.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/glasgow/">&lt;p&gt;We picked up a hire car in Edinburgh, then headed to Glasgow to meet Katherine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped at a few places we saw on the map on the way, first up  House Of The Binns which wasn&#x27;t that exciting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;glasgow&#x2F;binns.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we stopped at Linlithgow Palace. Okay view from outside but heaps of midgies, we didn&amp;#39;t both going inside. There was a wedding on at the church with the groomsmen wearing kilts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;glasgow&#x2F;linlithgow-palace.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coolest stop was the Falkirk Wheel. I told Rachael we were going to see a boat elevator but she didn&amp;#39;t believe me, and even when we got there she was convinced it was a road with busses until we walked up and saw the water.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;glasgow&#x2F;falkirk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when we saw it she still didn&amp;#39;t really beleive it. We walked further upstream and saw some loch&amp;#39;s fill and float boats up which helped it make a bit more sense.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;glasgow&#x2F;loch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video is a pretty good explanation:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;qHO9gARac-w?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we passed through Glasgow earlier it felt like Queen St in Brisbane, and driving in was even more like Brisbane and was like driving on the ICB. It must just have a similar architecture or something.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to Pollok House and Garden while we waited for our check-in time and to meet up with Katherine and co. There was some really nice gardens and was a good free place to visit. They even had free parking which wasn&amp;#39;t the case at any of the other stops that day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;glasgow&#x2F;pollok2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;glasgow&#x2F;pollok1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met up with Katherine, Tom and his brother Liam. We went to an awesome vegetarian Indian place for dinner that was super cheap and tasty - and very busy and booked out so we had to get takeaway.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was great having someone else organizing our day, and Katherine had planned out heaps of places for us to stop. First up was &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Finnich_Glen&quot;&gt;Devil Paulpit&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which she found from some blog about &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.outlanderlocations.com&#x2F;locations&#x2F;finnich-glen-devils-pulpit&#x2F;&quot;&gt;outlander&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Was super hard to find, and then even harder to work out how to get down but was an incredible stop. There was no signage and only a few other people which is crazy because it&amp;#39;s such a cool little spot.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;glasgow&#x2F;devil0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found an abandoned castle behind a gold course, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Buchanan_Castle&quot;&gt;Buchanan Castle&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up we went to Loch Lomond and climbed &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Conic_Hill&quot;&gt;Conic Hill&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
Was a nice little hike but when we got to the top the winds were just crazy, like mildly-cylonic strong.
It had great views of the lake, and the surrounding green hills.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;glasgow&#x2F;conic1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then checked out &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bracklinn_Falls&quot;&gt;Bracklinn Falls&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which was a nice waterfall and wooden bridge.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;glasgow&#x2F;bracklinn1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night we were staying at a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com.au&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@56.0578457,-4.3718828,281m&#x2F;data=!3m1!1e3&quot;&gt;castle&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Katherine found on AirBnB, which had fields with lambs and pheasants.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;glasgow&#x2F;airbnb-castle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we drove to Perth, where there was a lake good for wildlife watching. But it was mostly just bird watching, cost money and didn&amp;#39;t look that exciting. So we just went for a walk instead, we saw a deer and some red squirrels.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;glasgow&#x2F;perth1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About lunchtime we said goodbye to Katherine, Tom and Liam and started south on the motorway to England while they headed up to the highlands.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/edinburgh/">&lt;p&gt;After getting off the ferry we had a nice coastal drive on the bus to Edinburgh, briefly stopping at Glasgow on the way.
Edinburgh is a really cool looking city, with lots of nice buildings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to our airBnB which overlooked Arthur&#x27;s Seat and was hosted by a really nice guy Russell, who told us that the layers actually inspired the theory of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edinburghexpert.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;arthurs-seat-and-edinburghs-volcanoes&quot;&gt;tectonic plates&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we did the free walking tour and had an awesome guide, Sabela. We got to see some multi-level architecture, with buildings that have either 4 or 11 floors depending which side you go to because it&#x27;s so hilly. We saw some alleys, which are called a Close (because the builds are so close). We played the game Local or Tourist, where you watch people walk past the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Heart_of_Midlothian_%28Royal_Mile%29&quot;&gt;Heart of Midlothian&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and see if they sidestep and spit on it or stop to look at the pretty love heart. We heard of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;William_Brodie&quot;&gt;Deacon Brodie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; who was a keymaker by day who robbed his clients by night and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Grassmarket#As_a_place_of_execution&quot;&gt;half-hangit Maggie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Rachael&#x27;s favorite story was about the guys who stole &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stone_of_Scone#Removal_and_damage&quot;&gt;The Stone of Destiny&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - which we saw later at the castle.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learnt about how the church taught people to read the bible and learning to read brought about the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scottish_Enlightenment&quot;&gt;Scottish Enlightenment&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which brought about a whole bunch of philosophers like David Hume who was the first to promote the idea that you could have morals without religion. Since Edinburgh had all these philosophers they wanted to become Athens of the North and so built their own Parthenon at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Calton_Hill&quot;&gt;Calton Hill&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visited &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Greyfriars_Kirkyard&quot;&gt;Greyfriars Kirkyard&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which is a cemetery behind the cafe where J.K. Some of the people buried there include Thomas Riddle, a McGonagall and a Pettigrew.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;edinburgh&#x2F;cemetery.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Greyfriars%20Kirkyard&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a grave for Gregyfriars Bobby, which was a dog that guarded the grave of its owner for 14 years after he died, which reminded me of the Futurama episode Jurrasic Bark.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;edinburgh&#x2F;jurassic-bark.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Gregyfriars%20Bobby&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our tour we doubled back to St Giles&amp;#39; Cathedral and the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;St_Giles%27_Cathedral#Thistle_Chapel&quot;&gt;Thistle Chapel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which is inside the cathedral but not part of it, and is where the Scottish knights meet once a year and was pretty interesting to learn about.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;edinburgh&#x2F;knights.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then did a tour of Edinburgh Castle which had great views of the city, lots of cool rooms, and the crown jewels.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;edinburgh&#x2F;castle1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also saw the hall where the actual red wedding took place.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;edinburgh&#x2F;red-wedding.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Red%20wedding&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we went to the National Museum of Scotland, which was pretty good.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;edinburgh&#x2F;museum.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had a display on all the extinct animals which was interesting because they were all mostly from Australia or New Zealand. I guess they killed off everything in Europe before they had a chance to name all the species.
They also had a cool exhibit on communication history (telegraph, ocean internet cables) and a pretty good power and energy display. And they had Dolly the Sheep.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;edinburgh&#x2F;dolly.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Dolly%20the%20sheep&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon we walked up to see the Athens of the North.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;edinburgh&#x2F;athens.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Calton%20Hill&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we climbed Arthur&amp;#39;s seat, which had spectacular views and was a great little hike. We also saw our first pheasant.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;edinburgh&#x2F;arthurs-seat2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/channel/">&lt;p&gt;So we left Dublin early in the morning to avoid the traffic and made our way up north again to visit Slane.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were told by Matt and Angela to visit a hill with a view of the countryside and was a perfect sunny day so the views were spectacular.
There was a freezing cold wind though, so we didn&#x27;t stay long.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;channel&#x2F;slane-hill.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;channel&#x2F;cows.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went past Slane Castle but it was closed for renovations.
Nearby is the site of Newgrange, but we got there really early and it didn&amp;#39;t open until 9:30 so we just looked over the hedge.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;channel&#x2F;newgrange.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made a quick detour to drive along the ocean and then we were back across the Northern Ireland border.
There is no real signage other then the speed limits suddenly change from km&#x2F;h to miles&#x2F;h.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still had a few hours with the car before we had to return it, so we went up to look at Cavehill which is a mountain that inspired Gullivers Travels as apparently it looks like a giant and people hiking up its face inspired the author. Belfast Castle is up the top, so we stopped there for lunch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;channel&#x2F;belfast-castle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then hiked up the giant&amp;#39;s face and there was a great view of Belfast harbour. It was crazy windy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;channel&#x2F;cavehill2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We returned the car then went to our AirBnB. The next morning we got the ferry across the channel.
It was more like a cruise ship then a ferry, with several restaurants, games rooms and a cinema. But it was only a short trip so we just read and went on top to look at Scotland as we came in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/dublin/">&lt;p&gt;We got in from our drive in the afternoon, and parked at our airBnB which was hosted by a really lovely guy that made us a cuppa, gave us a map and helped us plan out what we wanted to see the next day. It was a bit of a dodgy suburb but lots of good student food places nearby, and we had some amazing Moroccan wraps.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we did a walking tour, and in more stereotypical Irish weather it was raining and cold.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guide was great and started with a history of Ireland, which was the first I really had properly learnt about the backstory to the potato famine and conflict with the English.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first main stop was &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dublin_Castle&quot;&gt;Dublin Castle&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and the The Dubhlinn (Black pool) Gardens.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dublin&#x2F;castle1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dublin&#x2F;castle3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to a church that became a pub, and the Temple Bar area. Finally we finished up at Trinity college, which was a beautiful university.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dublin&#x2F;trinity.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guide showed us the incredible &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Trinity_College_Library&quot;&gt;old library&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and the ugly arts building directly opposite. He told us how it was meant to be a recreation of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon but the concrete they used didn&amp;#39;t support plants (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.universitytimes.ie&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;trinitys-arts-building-often-condemned-and-surrounded-by-myth&#x2F;&quot;&gt;turns out this isn&amp;#39;t true&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After talking up the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Book_of_Kells&quot;&gt;Book of Kells&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and how it was once the most valuable item in the world, and how the library is like being in harry potter, we had to visit. Rachael loved the exhibit on the Book of Kells, but I was less impressed as I had seen something similar at the &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;sankt-gallen&quot;&gt;Abbey library of St. Gallen&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, although I remember being super impressed back then.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upstairs library itself was crazy impressive though, and they also had the original Brian Boru&amp;#39;s Harp that often represents Ireland as a logo.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dublin&#x2F;library1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachael doesn&amp;#39;t like beer so instead of visiting Guinness we went to the Irish Whiskey museum. There was a bit of a history about how it was invented and how Scotland stole their glory with their &amp;#39;inferior Scotch Whiskey&amp;#39;. And then we got to sample a few different styles. The most crazy thing I learnt was that some whiskey tastes better with water and some not. There was one in particular that just completely changed in flavour when you added the tinniest drop of water.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dublin&#x2F;whiskey1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt told us that we had to track down Molly Malone, and that when we saw her we&amp;#39;d know where to rub for good luck.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dublin&#x2F;molly.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guide pointed out when we were at the castle another great free library, the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chester_Beatty_Library&quot;&gt;Chester Beatty Library&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; so we went there as well. It had lots of religious history and I learnt about a few religions I hadn&amp;#39;t heard of and about some of the specific differences between Islam&#x2F;Judaism&#x2F;Christianity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dublin&#x2F;library2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to a nice park on the way home (St Stephen&amp;#39;s Green), and found a University for Newman Studies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dublin&#x2F;newman_studies.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we found an even nicer park, the Iveagh Gardens.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dublin&#x2F;sundial.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Synchronising%20with%20the%20sundial&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to an asian place for dinner called Neon noodles which was delicious, and you got a free soft serve with your noodles which was a bit unusual.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/northern-ireland/">&lt;p&gt;So we picked up a car and headed north to drive along the coast, which was great.
There wasn&#x27;t many cars and heaps of awesome scenery. We didn&#x27;t go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discovernorthernireland.com&#x2F;The-Dark-Hedges-Armoy-Ballymoney-P27502&quot;&gt;The Dark Hedges&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; but saw some cool roads like it in the area.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first tourist stop was Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge. The rope bridge itself was pretty tame and unexciting (the lady crossing behind us was freaking out), but the coastal scenery was pretty epic. The water was super clear and blue and we had great weather.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;northern-ireland&#x2F;bridge1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;northern-ireland&#x2F;bridge2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next stop was the Giant&amp;#39;s Causeway which was also great. The rocks reminded me of the rocks along the Tabletop Mountain hike back home. The name seemed a bit silly at first as I couldn&amp;#39;t really picture how it was a causeway but we hiked up the hill at the end and it did look like a caved in bridge across the channel.
Apparently there is a similar site on the other side in Scotland, formed when the islands were together millions of years ago.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We booked a random airBnB in the town of Sligo as it was on the way south.
The next drive was also incredible, especially the last bit with &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Benbulbin&quot;&gt;a big mountain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; shrouded in cloud.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sligo town looked fun, we went in for a dinner at a pub recommended by our host, The Swagman. We were a bit slow in working out it was an Australian theme pub but eventually cottoned on to why the menu had so many foods we liked, and they had VB cans on the wall. I had a really tasty steak sandwhich.
The house we stayed at was beatiful and in a nice neighbourhood, we didn&amp;#39;t actually want to leave the next morning and wished we weren&amp;#39;t just passing through.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More driving south, this time through some lava fields called &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Burren&quot;&gt;the Burren&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and some nice seaside towns.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;northern-ireland&#x2F;burren.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cliffs of Moher were incredible. Reminded me of &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;iaeste-jura-weekend&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Jura&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in Switzerland but with ocean at the bottom.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could leave the tourist centre and walk up further past farmland where there was no fence.
It was a really great walk and views, Rachael really didn&amp;#39;t like that there was no fence though and kept freaking out it would give way.
She wouldn&amp;#39;t even take a photo of me anywhere near the edge, but at least I didn&amp;#39;t put my legs over it like some people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;northern-ireland&#x2F;moher3.jpg&quot; title=&quot;no%20fence&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then yet more driving, but this time we went on the highway rather then the scenic way which was a lot faster.
We stopped at a castle on the way but too expensive so didn&amp;#39;t go in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;northern-ireland&#x2F;bunratty.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drove through Limerick and there was a soccer game on, so there was lots of traffic and people out.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the amount of driving we did, it&amp;#39;s a pretty small country and before we knew it where at Dublin!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/belfast/">&lt;p&gt;We flew into Belfast and got a bus in to the city and then to check into our hostel. Everywhere was really booked out in Belfast, and we were only able to book a 10 person dorm at &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vagabondsbelfast.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Vagabonds&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. We found an awesome burrito place for lunch that was a cross between subway and GyG. It was good being back in an English speaking country again, although Rachael still really struggled to understand what we were ordering with the accent which was pretty funny.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hostel was really cool, but hopefully we never have to book a 10 bed dorm again. Luckily we went to bed pretty early before everyone else got back, because apparently one guy was snoring so loud that one of the other girls didn&#x27;t sleep (and told us at breakfast she wanted to murder him). I woke up in the morning and heard him, and probably wouldn&#x27;t have been able to sleep hearing it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;belfast&#x2F;hostel.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Hostel%20breakfast%20area&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The living area was really cool, and we spoke to some other people in the hostel about where to visit while we were in Ireland. We didn&amp;#39;t think we would have time to get to the Cliffs of Moher but were persuaded it was worth the drive.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My phone plan had expired, but since we were back in the UK we could head into the city to renew it. The shopping centre had a really cool viewing platform where you could see the city, although the weather wasn&amp;#39;t great for visibility.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did a free walking tour later on in the morning, starting at City Hall. They had a display of all the people who died on the titanic, including two people that were under stolen identities. I didn&amp;#39;t actually realise the Titanic was built there and they also had a whole &amp;#39;Titanic Experience&amp;#39; which is a apparently great visit (similar to the Vasa Museum I guess) but we didn&amp;#39;t have time to visit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next on the tour, we went to the Europa hotel, which was bombed repeatedly by the IRA. It was opposite a really fancy bar, which joined on to another bar called Fibber&amp;#39;s McGee (like in Toowoomba).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Albert_Memorial_Clock,_Belfast&quot;&gt;leaning clock&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Salmon_of_Knowledge&quot;&gt;wise salmon&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and I think four &amp;#39;oldest bar in Belfast&amp;#39;. There was a really cool part of town with lots of pubs and restaurants that was a bit hipster with lots of cool graffiti.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;belfast&#x2F;alley.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Alley&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a really good tour, and Belfast was a surprisingly cool city and a shame we didn&amp;#39;t more time there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For lunch we had some amazing burgers, they like their make your own takeaway and this was like a Grill&amp;#39;d crossed with subway. They tasted amazing and were really cheap.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a free Ulster museum and botanical gardens near(ish) our hostel so we went there in the afternoon. The museum had a display of the period table with all the actual elements (stable ones at least). And we learnt a bit about &amp;#39;the troubles&amp;#39; and the IRA as this wasn&amp;#39;t covered in the tour we did. The gardens were nice too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;belfast&#x2F;greenhouse.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Botanical%20Gardens%20Greenhouse&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the pubs in town had cool names, like Filthy McNasty and The Dirty Onion. Our tour guide talked up going to see some Irish Music at Fitzy&amp;#39;s, and there was a local duo of girls playing that were really good, but it was more American&#x2F;Pop&#x2F;Country then Irish.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;belfast&#x2F;fitzys.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Fitzy&amp;#x27;s&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we picked up a hire car to explore the country side.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/paris/</id>
        
        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/paris/">&lt;p&gt;After very little sleep on the bus, and leaving over an hour late, it meant we arrived late in Paris and so hit peak hour traffic, making us later still and stuck in traffic at a crawl. The bus actually went near our hostel and then we spent probably an hour in traffic after that getting to the bus stop on the other side of the city.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus depot itself was pretty terrible, essentially a giant car park near a metro station. Luckily we finished there and didn&#x27;t wait there as there was no toilets, no cover and no food. We got a train to the hostel to find out they actually charge by the hour for luggage storage. So we had planned to go into the city but instead paid for a couple of hours and went to get food until we could check-in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;paris&#x2F;melting_house.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Train%20station%20near%20hostel&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hostel had a booking desk, and the lady told us we could buy skip the line tickets from her for much cheaper due to a special deal and it also included audio-guides. It seemed to be good to be true but she was adamant. Turns out she was full of shit though, as we got there and they said no we had to line up (which took 2 hours) and then it didn&amp;#39;t even include an audioguide.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the same hostel we stayed at &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-paris&quot;&gt;last time&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and we thought was great, except this time I have to give the opposite review. So at this point neither of us was in a particularly good mood, and Rachael was starting to get sick so was at a point where she just wanted to cancel the holiday and go home.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually we made it to the front of the line though, and the catacombs themselves were incredible and worth the wait. The first part was just miners tunnels which were pretty cool, but not what we waited 2 hours to see. And then you get to the bones, of which there was a mind-blowing amount and the tunnels just kept on going. It was hard to fathom that they were all people once and the sheer number of bodies dumped down there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;paris&#x2F;catacombs1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;paris&#x2F;catacombs2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;paris&#x2F;catacombs4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;paris&#x2F;catacombs5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;paris&#x2F;catacombs6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were in a much better mood when we came out, and then went to visit the Luxembourg Gardens.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;paris&#x2F;luxembourg1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;paris&#x2F;luxembourg2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we went to the Château de Versailles. Which we got there early but was still packed with tourists, which despite this was also incredible. It was like the Vatican with the amazing paintings on every surface except even grander. Unfortunately lots of the palace was closed for renovations which was annoying because it didn&amp;#39;t say this anywhere when we booked the tickets or even the tourist information they gave out once you got in. The audio guide would say to go one way and then someone would say sorry you can&amp;#39;t go down there it&amp;#39;s closed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;paris&#x2F;versailles.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;paris&#x2F;versailles1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also interesting to see what was considered valuable then, as the grandest part was the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hall_of_Mirrors&quot;&gt;Hall of Mirrors&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which at the time showed incredible wealth as most people could not afford a mirror, let alone an entire hallway of them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;paris&#x2F;versailles2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you get out of the palace itself, it was time to visit the gardens. They are also incredible in their scale, better then any other gardens we have been to and the fountains were all turned off that day, so I imagine it&amp;#39;s even better when they are on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;paris&#x2F;versailles3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;paris&#x2F;versailles4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was another whole grounds in the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hameau_de_la_Reine&quot;&gt;Marie Antoinette garden&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which was probably the highlight as there were heaps of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com.au&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@48.8145288,2.109453,285a,35y,355.57h,39.38t&#x2F;data=!3m1!1e3&quot;&gt;different paths and styles&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and we probably didn&amp;#39;t even see a quarter of the grounds.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally we headed back into the city, and had some delicious Sri Lankan for dinner.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning Rachael was sick, so I went out myself to the see La Basilique du Sacré Cœur de Montmartre which has a great view of the city. I got there pretty early and there wasn&amp;#39;t many people around, just scam artists and some guy that wanted to sell me weed. It had a nice view but couldn&amp;#39;t really see any landmarks, and could only just see Eiffel Tower if you looked at the right angle. The church itself was pretty impressive.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;paris&#x2F;basilica1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time we stayed in Paris we thought it was great and wanted to stay longer, but this time we were mostly glad to leave. We were glad we came back for a second visit though, as the Catacombs and Versailles where well worth it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airport seemed to have changed a lot since last time we were there, and was a much better experience then last time. It was a nice quick flight and crazy how small the English channel is from the air. Was cool seeing Dover after being there could just make out the white cliffs and the harbour and ships.
Paris seemed dirtier and not as nice as last time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/munich/">&lt;p&gt;We arrived and it was raining, so we quickly dropped out bags at the hostel and went to get lunch. We went to Augustine Keller and got pork knuckle since I had it last time I was in Munich and thought it was great. It was super fatty and wasn&#x27;t as nice as last time, which I expect was mostly because I wasn&#x27;t massively hungover from Oktoberfest. Rachael loved the building though and her spinach and mountain cheese soup.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;munich&#x2F;Schweinshaxe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We quickly visited Marienplatz and then back to hostel to check in. Next we went to Theresienwiese so I could show Rachael where Oktoberfest is held and the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bavaria_statue&quot;&gt;Bavaria statue&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I had no idea you can go inside it (we didn&amp;#39;t though) as I assume it was closed during Oktoberfest.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;munich&#x2F;Bavaria_statue.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I tried to show Rachael a recreation of the walking tour I did &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;oktoberfest&quot;&gt;last time&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which went okay except everything was closed for winter and it was raining. We went to see the May Pole but it was missing, and the churches were all closed for services. We went to Hofgarden, which would have been great if the weather was nicer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;munich&#x2F;Hofgarten.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that I really wished I&amp;#39;d seen last time was the Eisbachwelle surfing spot in the Englischer Garten, so we went there and despite Rachael saying nobody would be surfing in the freezing rain, there was heaps of people out. It was fun to watch, but eventually the cold rain got to use so we headed back to the hostel.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;munich&#x2F;surfer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;munich&#x2F;surf_sign.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got a free beer for checking in, it was massive!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;munich&#x2F;free_beer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For breakfast in the morning they coloured in the eggs though, which was cool. Also we ran into a girl in the lobby that Rachael and I both knew from Rocky who now lives in London.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;munich&#x2F;easter_eggs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church bells rang like crazy the whole time we were there, was really strange as they weren&amp;#39;t on the hour just at random times. Nearly all the shops were closed for Easter which combined with the cold rain meant the next day wasn&amp;#39;t particularly great.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked in English garden in the morning but then it started to rain heavy again so we just hung out in the hostel lobby for the rest of the day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked to church during a break in the rain at lunch time, and managed to get in between services.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;munich&#x2F;church.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we went to the bus station to wait for our overnight bus to Paris. We went to Vapianos for dinner, and had a really grumpy pizza maker and generally bad service compared to the one in Brisbane. We stayed there for a while as it was still pouring rain and freezing cold (I think it snowed later that night).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bus ended up getting delayed several times, and they had terrible signage and changed which bay we were meant to wait at repeatedly. Then when the bus arrived no one seemed to have any idea about how to queue and just rushed onto the bus to get good seats. Since we waited to ask where to put out luggage we ended up having to split up. Eventually the guy next to Rachael got off at at one of the stops and so we were able to sleep. I was expecting a night bus to have much comfier seats that reclined (like the different set up for night trains), but no such luck - it was just a normal bus. After the airport in Berlin, we were left with the impression that while Germany has a good train system, bus stops and airports are terrible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/salzburg/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;salzburg&#x2F;river.jpg&quot; title=&quot;River&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left my Kindle on the train when we arrived in Salzburg which was a bummer, and the first thing we lost for the trip.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old town was pretty, but outside of the old town wasn&amp;#39;t very exciting. One thing we noticed was just how fast the water in the river was flowing, and the hugh amounts of water pouring in from the various little storm water outlets.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were lots of references to Mozart, for example his house&#x2F;museum&#x2F;your local SPAR supermarket.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;salzburg&#x2F;mozart_spar.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Mozart%20Museum&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was actually interesting how standard the shops were but they were done up to look authentic, like on Getreidegasse the McDonalds had a really old style golden arch sign that was in the same style as the rest of the shops in the street. There was also lots of little cool side alleys everywhere, and it is a stark contrast being in a city that was designed for pedestrians well before the invention of cars.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to the Festung Hohensalzburg (Fortress) for a concert but the ticket included looking around before hand. It had really nice views of the city.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;salzburg&#x2F;fortress2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Festung%20Hohensalzburg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then saw a Mozart concert which was really good, but I didn&amp;#39;t recognise as many of the songs as I was expecting to. You could tell they were very talented musicians as it looked very technically difficult.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;salzburg&#x2F;concert.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day went for walk through Mirabell Palace Gardens, which were really nice. The actual palace was closed though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;salzburg&#x2F;gardens1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;salzburg&#x2F;gardens2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the churches were closed for Easter services, but we did go in one really cool one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;salzburg&#x2F;church.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was another one with a graveyard out the back, which also had buildings carved into the cliff-side.
&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;salzburg&#x2F;graves.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked up on ridge and found a nice grassy that looked out over the Alps was nice. You could faintly make out a gondola going up and down the mountain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;salzburg&#x2F;landscape.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately most things were shut while we were there but we still enjoyed out time. We had really nice Indian for dinner.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we had a lazy morning as it was raining, and then got a ticket on the next train to Munich (which was a massive wait of 4 minutes).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/bled/">&lt;p&gt;We got a train from Ljubljana to Lesce-Bled to a cool hostel that used to be a monastery.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got a bus to Bled itself and hiked up to the castle that overlooks the lake.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;bled&#x2F;lakeside1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;bled&#x2F;island.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were going to hire a boat but it started to rain, so we had lunch and waited a bit for it to clear.
One thing we weren&amp;#39;t expecting were the huge snow-covered alpine mountains in the background.
Also that lots of things would be closed, one gorge we wanted to visit unfortunately didn&amp;#39;t open until a week later.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun came out for a bit, so we looked at renting a boat again, but only one place was open and they recommended against it in case it rained again.
The tourist information centre recommended hiking up Osojnica, which was a bit steeper then we were epecting but had great panoramic views of the lake.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;bled&#x2F;hike1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;bled&#x2F;hike2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we went canyoning, which had been recommended to us and was the main reason we came to Bled.
The water was pretty cold, and we only got wetsuits this time (not drysuits) but it was incredibly fun.
Rachael did better then I was expecting and only really struggled with the first jump. Because it was very early in the tourist season it was just us and the guide. The water was also full of salamanders.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;bled&#x2F;canyon1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon we went back to Bled to get a boat this time and row to island. It was fun being on the water, but the island itself wasn&amp;#39;t too exciting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;bled&#x2F;rowboat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still had one day free and with the gorge closed, we decided to go on a hot air balloon ride.
We had to get up really early, then set a helium balloon off to work out the launch site.
Again, it ended up being a private ride as it was early in the season.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our pilot was Slovenian but had just come back from Melbourne, where he works part of the year as his daughter lives there now. So he&amp;#39;d actually left Australia after us. He was a really interesting guy and runs the company with his wife.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;bled&#x2F;balloon6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the ride we had some champagne to celebrate the successful flight (and Rachael got quite drunk). And then we headed back to Lake Bled for some Bled Cake, which is basically an amazing vanilla slice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then spent most of the rest of the day relaxing and planning where we were going next (finding accommodation and transport over Easter late notice proved quite difficult).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While waiting for our train to Austria the next day, we saw a train go past with carriage after carriage of brand new Mercedes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just visited Ljublana as a stopover on our way to Bled, but it ended up being a super pretty city with nice canals and streets. The bus trip had really nice scenery on the way in also. The hostel we stayed out was in the middle of a busy street in the old town and was a bit bizarre really, as it was really quiet inside and they you step out the front door in the middle of a super busy lane-way with a view up to the castle.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;ljubljana&#x2F;castle_view.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Views%20from%20castle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, we got a funicular up to the castle which had nice views. Then walked back down and just walked around the old town and canals.
For dinner we had a really nice blue vein cheese pizza out the front of the canal.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/croatia/">&lt;p&gt;We landed in Zagreb and picked up our rental car. We wanted to go to see the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Plitvice_Lakes_National_Park&quot;&gt;Plitvice Lakes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; but after looking at transport options decided a rental car was our only option and we wouldn&#x27;t have time to go visit any of the beaches in Croatia. Because multiple drivers costs lots more, we got it in Rachael&#x27;s name and then she she had a bit of a mild panic attack because you drive on the other side of the road and the gears were reversed. Once we got off the highway the roads were terrible and everyone was speeding, and we thought maybe we had made a terrible decision.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually we got there and the lakes were incredible! Well even the car park area was cool and the burgers at the information centre delicious.
Then we walked down to the lakes and there were just waterfalls everywhere. The water was crystal clear and the wooden walkways just above it on cool wooden planks. We didn&#x27;t realise there was actually a recommended circuit until later, but we did a big walk on one side and then got a boat to other side. Then we did another big walk with even bigger waterfalls and a cool cave system. It was unlike anywhere else I&#x27;ve been in the world and absolutely worth the visit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accommodation was okay and easy to find. We had a great (fancy but cheap) dinner up the road that had calamari with mash and Turkey with gnocchi. Having the exchange rate work on your favour again was great.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;croatia&#x2F;dinner.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Dinner&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the next day we had to have another stressful drive back to Zagreb. We did stop at a cool town on the way that had waterfalls under the buildings. And we managed to return the car without incident, and were glad to be rid of it!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;croatia&#x2F;Rastoke.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Rastoke&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Zagreb we got a FlixBus to Slovenia, because it&amp;#39;s outside the Schengen Zone there was a crazy border crossing had trucks backed up for kilometers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;croatia&#x2F;bordercrossing.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Border%20Crossing%20into%20Slovenia&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a bit intimidating as they didn&amp;#39;t really explain what was going on (not in English anyway), but after waiting around for ages and getting our passports stamped we were back on our way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/berlin/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;berlin&#x2F;roomview.jpg&quot; title=&quot;View%20from%20our%20AirBnB&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got in to Berlin quite late, but got up early the next day to do the free walking tour.
We learnt heaps of history about the war, and the berlin wall and cold war.
One of the first stops was the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Memorial_to_the_Murdered_Jews_of_Europe&quot;&gt;Jew Memorial&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which when we saw it was really familiar as I&amp;#39;d seen it on TV and the internet. The designer did a great job, as when you walk through it, it&amp;#39;s nothing like what you expect. All the blocks are slightly different and in the middle it goes really deep and some are really tall. The guide said the designer refused to explain what it represented, and it was up to everyone that visited to interpret it for themselves. Reading the wiki article though, it says it was &amp;quot;designed to produce an uneasy, confusing atmosphere, and the whole sculpture aims to represent a supposedly ordered system that has lost touch with human reason&amp;quot; which actually describes it really well. Each of the minorities that were persecuted got their own memorial, rather then grouping them all together, which is a nice thought. Our guide also pointed out how great it is that the Germans are so open about the past, to ensure it doesn&amp;#39;t happen again with the memorials in the middle of the city on prime real estate. Pretty much all the ex-colonies (like Australia) have a terrible history where they invaded, but that&amp;#39;s mostly ignored so I think it&amp;#39;s really great that they acknowledge it. The German parliament was also a cool building, with a see through viewing platform above it so you can look down on the politicians and they can always look up to see who they represent (the tour guide pointed out mostly tourists). You need to book an appointment ages in advance though, so unfortunately we couldn&amp;#39;t go up. Thinking about it also reminded me of a comment Jan said to me when he visited on Australia Day, and about how great he thought it was to have a day where we could celebrate your nationality and that they can&amp;#39;t really have that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;berlin&#x2F;brandenburggate.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Brandenburg%20Gate&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;berlin&#x2F;jewmemorial.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Memorial%20to%20the%20Murdered%20Jews%20of%20Europe&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also visited the car park which was built on top of the bunker where Hitler shot himself, and saw parts of the Berlin Wall and Checkpoint Charlie. The tour stopped at a cafe for lunch which actually had cheap but amazing chicken schnitzel bagels. The final stop was wear a large book burning took place, and the square had an underground room which you could look down into, that had bookshelves with no books on them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the tour, we walked to museum island, and there appeared to be some sort of political rally going on. When we got closer we saw that they were filming movie. All the museums had awesome architecture, but were expensive so we didn&amp;#39;t go in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;berlin&#x2F;movie.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Movie%20filming%20on%20museum%20island&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.memu.berlin&#x2F;en&#x2F;exhibition&#x2F;menschen-museum&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Menschen Museum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which was the thing that Rachael was most looking forward to in Berlin. It was okay, I was expecting it to be more about science but it was presented more like an art gallery. Seeing a real spinal cord and the tiny bone in your ear were pretty cool though. Afterwards we had lunch at an amazing Vietnamese restaurant. Germany was great for having amazing cheap food after being in the Scandinavian countries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon we walked along the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;East_Side_Gallery&quot;&gt;East Side Gallery&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which is a section of the Berlin Wall near where we were staying with murals. Apparently it&amp;#39;s the hipster part of town and their are clubs that are open 24&#x2F;7 (haven&amp;#39;t closed in like 7 years) and a club that you have to wait in line for like 4 hours only to probably get told that you are dressed wrong and can&amp;#39;t come in. it was weird to think about something like that happening so recently in history (when I was a baby as opposed to before I was born anyway). On the other side of the river there were definitely lots of hipster restaurants and we went to a park that actually seemed like American parks you see in the movies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;berlin&#x2F;berlinwall.jpg&quot; title=&quot;East%20Side%20Gallery&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to visit &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sachsenhausen_concentration_camp&quot;&gt;Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which was as miserable as you would imagine but worth the visit. The weather was very appropriate with a bitter cold wind making it horrible to stand outside in our jackets (in Spring), while we were told that prisoners had to stand out basically wearing nothing for hours on end in the middle of winter. Given the prisoners were essentially worked to death in -20, we couldn&amp;#39;t complain too much.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;berlin&#x2F;Sachsenhausen.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Sachsenhausen&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to go to a a German pub for dinner to lighten the mood and had some good beer, and okay food. Afterwards we popped in for a drink at Hofbraü Berlin so Rachael could get a small taste of what Oktoberfest was like.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;berlin&#x2F;hofbrauhaus.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Hofbra%C3%BC&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next day we caught a train to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kaiser_Wilhelm_Memorial_Church&quot;&gt;a church&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that was destroyed in the war and left up as a memorial. Was pretty crazy seeing all the artillery holes in the side of the walls, and the damage inside.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;berlin&#x2F;MemorialChurch1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;berlin&#x2F;MemorialChurch2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then got a bus to the Tiergarten and climb up the victory column (which I had never heard of). It also had bullet holes on it, was a good view from the top but very crowded. They should limit number of people at a time, as it ruined the experience a bit and we wouldn&amp;#39;t have minded a small wait. It was a very long staircase climb to the top. There was a cool underpass system under the roundabout, and there was a busker playing guitar that found the perfect spot to play so that it echoed all over the square and sounded awesome.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;berlin&#x2F;VictoryColumn1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Tiergarten&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;berlin&#x2F;VictoryColumn2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Tiergarten&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For lunch we got amazing kebabs that had chips in them, and Rachael had a Halloumi one which was equally awesome. Berlin really does have great street food.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we went to the gardens at Schloss Charlottenburg, which were good but not super amazing.
&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;berlin&#x2F;CharlotteCastle.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Charlottenburg%20Grounds&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to get up really early for our flight, and then when we got there it was closed until 2 hours before our flight. When they did eventually open there was huge lines and security was super tedious and badly organised, it seemed very un-german compared to their rail system.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/copenhagen/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;copenhagen&#x2F;boat1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Hawila%20Project&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Varberg, it is as simple as catching a commuter train across the sea to Denmark. Which is pretty crazy, and Johan mentioned how sometimes he pops over to Copenhagen to do some shopping!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up booking a boat to stay on through airBnB for something different. It was kind of cool, Rachael wasn&amp;#39;t a fan as it had a pump toilet and the shower was apparently terrible. But it was a cool novel place to stay for one night.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;copenhagen&#x2F;boat2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Hawila%20Project&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had planned to do a walking tour that day, but were my card stopped working so we couldn&amp;#39;t get any cash out until I got it unfrozen and Danish Kroner are different to the Swedish Kroner and Icelandic Kroner. The changing exchange rate was also annoying, I&amp;#39;m glad the Euro now exists for some countries at least.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we ended up doing all the free things we could find in Copenhagen, and paying for things we had to (like food) on the credit card. We got a metro driverless train to the city, which were really regular and pretty fast. We stopped to have a look at the Church of our Saviour, which had a really cool tower. Unfortunately there was a huge line to go up and it cost money, so we decided to keep exploring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;copenhagen&#x2F;ChurchofOurSaviour.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Church%20of%20our%20Saviour&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of cool canals, this one had some sort of statue under the water.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;copenhagen&#x2F;canal.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Canal%20Statue?&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was stunningly good weather, and we walked through The King&amp;#39;s Garden which was nice, but would have been even nicer about a week later as everything was just starting to bloom but not quite. From here we walked across to the botanic gardens, which had a greenhouse which was steaming hot.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;copenhagen&#x2F;botanic1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Botanic%20gardens&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some great little walks and the lake, with heaps of people out enjoying the sunshine (although it was still cold). There were heaps of cyclists on the streets, we saw 2 heavily pregnant women riding which made Rachael concede that she probably can manage the short ride to work in the morning in Toowoomba where it&amp;#39;s not really that cold.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;copenhagen&#x2F;botanic2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Botanic%20gardens&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;copenhagen&#x2F;botanic3.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Botanic%20gardens&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then more walking to dockside (we had a day ticket for the metro but walking wasn&amp;#39;t much slower), although we ended up doing ~18km each day so was pretty tiring. They had lots of pretty shops along the canal, but all a bit fancy for me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;copenhagen&#x2F;Nyhavn.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Nyhavn&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then walked up to Kastellet Fortress, stopping at the Little Mermaid statue along the way (pretty unexciting). The fortress was really cool, the rampart is in the shape of a star so we walked along the rim of it, there were lots of people out for a jog, which would be a cool little daily circuit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;copenhagen&#x2F;Kastellet1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Kastellet&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we stopped in at a big dome church on the way back to the boat.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;copenhagen&#x2F;FrederiksKirke2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dinner we went to a cafe in a shopping centre, which was very average for the price and we got table water and they charged us like $5 for it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day Rachael found out there was a museum that was free on Tuesdays. But it didn&amp;#39;t open until 11, so first we went to see the Tivoli Gardens (which were basically closed for winter) and City Hall. City Hall was a beautiful building, and had a thing called the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jens_Olsen%27s_World_Clock&quot;&gt;Jens Olsen&amp;#39;s World Clock&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which I thought was really fascinating (Rachael not so much). It had things such as the time in all the different time zones, as well as positions of the planets, and adjusts the date for leap years, which is incredible for a mechanical clock but probably taken for granted now that it&amp;#39;s done automatically by software on our phones.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;copenhagen&#x2F;cityhall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;copenhagen&#x2F;worldclock.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek (the free museum Rachael found) would have absolutely been worth the price of admission and was huge.
Some of the art was a bit plain, but the statues were amazing. There was a nice garden in the middle as well. They also had some side exhibits like some egyptian mummies and roman sculptures.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;copenhagen&#x2F;Glyptotek1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards we went to see another garden in the city and then caught the metro back to grab our bags and catch our flight.
We made one more detour to Kastrupfort Fortress which was way less impressive then the other one, but had a good view of some wind farms out at sea.
It was an exhausting two days, but we saw a lot and were really glad that we made the stop on the way to Berlin instead of flying directly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/vargberg/">&lt;p&gt;Next up we got a train to Guttenberg to meet my friend Johan. I was surprised by the amount of forest on the train ride, unfortunately our train seat didn&#x27;t have a window but from what we could see there wasn&#x27;t many towns on the way. We met Johan at Guttenberg then went to meatball house, and got some Swedish meatballs which were delicious.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here Johan drove us to his new apartment in Varberg. It was a really nice place, and the area really reminded me of Turgi. We went to the grocery store and bottle-o, interestingly Johan said that alcohol over 3.5% can only be sold at a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Systembolaget&quot;&gt;government run store&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, where we bought some really nice Swedish wheat beer.
It was Johan&#x27;s birthday, so went out to a nice Indian place for dinner.  Johan&#x27;s place even had ocean views.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;vargberg&#x2F;sunset.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Varberg%20Sunset&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning was really foggy, so we thought it would be a good time to go back into Guttenberg and visit Universium. It was a science museum but also had a cool rainforest and aquarium. It also had a cool space section where they had scales that had your weight on different planets.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;vargberg&#x2F;Universium1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Universium&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;vargberg&#x2F;Universium2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Universium&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back we stopped at an English-Style castle called Tjolöholms slott.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;vargberg&#x2F;castle.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Tjol%C3%B6holms%20slott&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we went to see the Varberg Fortress, there was also a really interesting looking swimming pool structure at the beach. They had photos of people swimming in the middle of winter when the ocean is frozen, but the water looked nice the day we were there (it was still way too cold though).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;vargberg&#x2F;fortress.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Varbergs%20F%C3%A4stning&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;vargberg&#x2F;bath.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Kallbadhuset&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to meet Johan&amp;#39;s parents and had a lovely home cooked meal. They also lived near a really nice beach, I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting Sweden to have nice beaches.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;vargberg&#x2F;beach.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we went for a drive inland and went for a walk along some of the lakes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;vargberg&#x2F;lake.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johan was an excellent host, and we had an amazing time in Sweden. It wasn&amp;#39;t what I was expecting at all and was also great having a local experience. We learnt lots and found out heaps of interesting things you wouldn&amp;#39;t normally, like the fact that Denmark is so close that the TV could pick up both Swedish and Danish channels, and that they have a self serve checkout system over there where you get a handheld scanner to take with you and scan the items as you shop.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/stockholm/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;stockholm&#x2F;stockholm.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Stockholm&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We flew into Stockholm and it was snowing outside when we arrived, not something we were expecting for Spring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got a train from the airport into the city and checked into our AirBnB. We then went for a walk around the old town which was full of pretty buildings. We visited
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;medeltidsmuseet.stockholm.se&#x2F;in-english&#x2F;&quot;&gt;a free medieval museum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which was on a little island next to the Royal Palace. Was a really cool area and the museum was pretty interesting. The old town itself was nice to just walk around.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;stockholm&#x2F;medieval.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Medieval%20Museum&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left early the next morning to walk to Skansen, after picking up some awesome pastry for breakfast from Coop.
Skansen is an open air museum and zoo, but since it was still cold most things were closed and the animals were hibernating or not around. We did see some reindeer and wolves, and there was great views from the hill, but overall we weren&amp;#39;t super impressed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;stockholm&#x2F;skansen1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Skansen&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;stockholm&#x2F;skansen2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Skansen&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;stockholm&#x2F;skansen3.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Wolves&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to Skansen there was a really cool looking biological museum. We thought it was part of the Skansen ticket, but it wasn&amp;#39;t and was pretty expensive admission. The guy on the door gave us a discount though, and it had a really cool double helix staircase.  The exhibit was mostly unchanged in 100 years, and while it wasn&amp;#39;t that impressive after being to the natural history museum in London, at the time it was built it must have seemed incredible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we went to the Vasa Museum, which was definitely the highlight of Stockholm for us. The &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vasamuseet.se&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Vasa&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was a massive warship that sank on it&amp;#39;s maiden voyage. They recently pulled it out of the water and restored it, and built a giant museum around it. The museum has so much more to offer then I was expecting, for example they have a floor where they have the skeletons of the crew that died when it sank, along with their belongings and clothes, which allowed them to learn a huge amount of detail about how people lived during that time period.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;stockholm&#x2F;vasa1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Vasa&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Vasa Museum, we were starving and walked into the city to get a late lunch. We were going to look around, but it started raining, so we got the train back to the accommodation. Once it started to cool it turned to snow again later in the evening.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/iceland/">&lt;p&gt;For our last day in Iceland we went to the Blue Lagoon Geothermal Spa. It stinks of sulphur as you come in but you get used to it after a bit. I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like it that much as it&#x27;s more Rachael&#x27;s thing, but was pretty fun.
They had a steam bath which was intense as you walk in as it&#x27;s dark and the steam is so thick you can hardly breathe. It was pretty overwhelming so we didn&#x27;t like it, but I tried it again later and it was more enjoyable. It was nice standing out in the freezing cold breeze and then going in. The main reason I liked it though was that it was in the middle of the lava fields so was a nice view from the pool.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;iceland&#x2F;bluelagoon1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Blue%20Lagoon&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spa is actually next to a geothermal power station, which was cool to see with steam just pouring out of it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;iceland&#x2F;geothermal.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Svartsengi%20Geothermal%20Power%20Station&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, we just walked around the city. There was some nice parks and a lake.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;iceland&#x2F;lake_statue.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to a place for dinner that had hot soups in a cob loaf, and it was delicious.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;iceland&#x2F;soup_bread.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Soup%20Bread&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that night, there was a jazz band at the hostel who were pretty good. Although, we didn&amp;#39;t stay too long as we had to get up really early for our flight the next morning.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/iceland-silfra/">&lt;p&gt;Monday we had much nicer weather, and it was the day Rachael was most looking forward to. I showed her this &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;5adC3nc0MHI?t=2m36s&quot;&gt;Smarter Everyday Video&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; when we were planning our trip and since then snorkeling at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Silfra&quot;&gt;Silfra&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was what she was most looking forward to.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s actually part of the Þingvellir fields, so we got the bus back again. The drive and views were so much better with the sun out. We then put on our drysuits, which were pretty much like putting on a wetsuit. Rachael really struggled to get hers on, but she hadn&#x27;t used a wetsuit before either. The water actually felt really warm when you got in, the suits do an amazing job of keeping the water out (one guy in our group didn&#x27;t have a good seal and got a bit wet and had to go back to fix it though). We also bumped into Lauren and her work friends, who were diving after us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The snorkel was incredible, the water was incredibly clear and there was a slight current from the glacial melt that pushed you along. The water was the most vivid blue, and you could see tiny algae floating in the water.
Towards the end the cold really started to seep in, my feet, hands and face eventually went numb from the cold.
At the end of the snorkel was a small open sandy bit with ducks swimming around with us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hurt to walk back to the car park because my toes felt like they were about to fall off.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got a joint package to also go see a lava cave. We weren&amp;#39;t expecting much I thought it would be a bit touristy, but it was in the middle of nowhere at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;maps&#x2F;fxEiqh7T9qS2&quot;&gt;Lavacave Leiđarendi&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Even from above the cave was incredible views, just lava as far as you could see in one direction and snow capped mountains behind us in the other.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;iceland-silfra&#x2F;lavacave3.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Lavacave%20Track&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cave tour was more adventurous then I was expecting too, with some narrow places where you had to crawl.
At one point Rachael thought she saw a finger and freaked out, but it was just a rock. The tour guide said that she  will now be part of the stories that he tells other visitors. We turned off all our lights at one point to experience the absolute darkness which was also a cool experience. There was also heaps of giant icicles.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we had an absolutely incredible day, and I looked up the aurora forecast which said there would be activity that night so we booked a Northern Lights tour as well. The tour itself was a bit of a rort, the bus picked us up at 7 and then we waited just 5mins down the road for about an hour for it to get dark. They then took us about 20mins out of town but there was still a fair bit of light pollution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issues with the tour didn&amp;#39;t matter too much because as soon as you hopped off the bus, you could see the lights faintly. Because you can&amp;#39;t see colours well at night, they don&amp;#39;t look like the photos. It just looked like a normal thin greyish cloud, but the way it danced across the sky was what made it impressive. I got a photo on my phone that captured pretty well what it looked like to the naked eye. It&amp;#39;s actually one time where it&amp;#39;s better to look through your camera...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;iceland-silfra&#x2F;aurora-realistic.jpg&quot; title=&quot;What%20the%20Aurora%20looked%20like&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point early on, it came over really bright and vivid for about 60 seconds. I could actually make out pink and green colours and the way it moved across the sky looked incredible. It was extremely impressive and the guide so it was the best that it had been in about a month. It wasn&amp;#39;t as good for the rest of the night but still visible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Lauren was also in Iceland that night, they text us to say they could see it from the hottub of their AirBnB. If we&amp;#39;d had a car we would have gone further from the city and it would have been way better, but we were still pretty lucky to see it as good as we did in the short time we had in the country.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got some better photos with the camera using a long exposure (didn&amp;#39;t have a tripod so not great).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;iceland-silfra&#x2F;aurora-exposure.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Aurora%20long%20exposure&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was an excellent day, probably the best of our trip.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/iceland-golden-circle/</id>
        
        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/iceland-golden-circle/">&lt;p&gt;We flew in to Iceland in the afternoon and the area just looked bleak, with no trees in sight.
When we originally booked, we thought the airport was in Reykjavík itself (there is a domestic one), but Keflavik International Airport is actually about an hour bus trip from the city. The bus trip was pretty unreal, it was just a dead straight well-maintained highway with no trees and barely any other cars. Once you get closer to Reykjavík there starts to be buildings and trees, but the first part is just the middle of nowhere.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed at KEX Hostel, which has a cool bar area and there was band playing when we arrived. The food in Iceland is crazy expensive and so we just bought some snacks for dinner at an expensive convenience store. We booked a Golden Circle bus tour for the next day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First stop on the tour was &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;%C3%9Eingvellir&quot;&gt;Þingvellir&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; where you can see the tectonic places. It wasn&#x27;t much of a tour as they didn&#x27;t tell you that much, pretty much dropped you off and said be back on the bus in an hour (they did give a tiny bit of backstory on the drive to each stop). It was a pretty cool area but was freezing cold and starting to rain. It&#x27;s a rift valley and you can see where the tectonic plates have been pushed up out of the ground. Some scenes from Game of Thrones were filmed there also.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;iceland-golden-circle&#x2F;Pingvellir2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;%C3%9Eingvellir&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stop was &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gullfoss&quot;&gt;Gullfloss Waterfall&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which reminded me of
&lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;neuhausen-am-rheinfall&quot;&gt;Rheinfall&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in Switzerland. The weather was absolutely terrible, with icy cold wind and rain. So we had a very quick look then went into the restaurant, and got what was probably the most expensive toasted ham and cheese sandwich in the world. After warming up we went out again for another quick look. If the weather had been better I&amp;#39;m sure I would have enjoyed it a lot more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last stop on the &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;, we went to see &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Geysir&quot;&gt;Geysir&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which is the geyser that geysers are named after. We didn&amp;#39;t see Geysir errupt, but the Strokkur geysir errupted pretty regularly. There was also a couple of small one&amp;#39;s that bubbled away that were cool. The whole place smelled of sulphur of course, and it was still raining off and on and freezing cold. Again, would have been much better if the weather was better, although it did start to clear up a bit at the end before we had to leave.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;iceland-golden-circle&#x2F;Geysir.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Geysir&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course once we had seen all the main sites, the sun came out and the weather became lovely. Pretty annoying, but it did make for an epic bus trip back and the views were incredible (couldn&amp;#39;t see anything on the way there really due to the rain). We also stopped at an &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.south.is&#x2F;en&#x2F;services&#x2F;the-quake-2008&quot;&gt;earthquake exhibit&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; at a Shopping Centre in Hveragerði which was pretty cool, the ground had literally split in half at the shopping centre in 2008, so they made a tourist attraction out of it. It also gave us a chance to buy some food at a supermarket as they have really short opening hours in Iceland and would have been closed by the time we got back.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we got back to Reykjavík we went for a walk around the city and went to the see the church on the top of the hill (Hallgrímskirkja).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;iceland-golden-circle&#x2F;church1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Hallgr%C3%ADmskirkja&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found a place that had hot soup noodles for dinner, they didn&amp;#39;t have any tables free, so we got takeaway and ate them on the oceanfront. Was still pretty cold, but was nice with the sky cleared up and the noodles were boiling hot and tasty.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to Richmond Park in the morning, and the girls had breakfast at a cafe which was packed with cyclists.
The park was huge, and it was great weather so we went for a walk. We&amp;#39;d heard there was deer but it&amp;#39;s a huge park and we couldn&amp;#39;t see any. So we went for a drive to look at the lake in the middle and the deer just happened to be there. They were pretty passive compared to the few other deer I have seen in the wild, so must be pretty used to people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;leaving-london&#x2F;deer.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Richmond%20Park%20Deer&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were a little bit rushed for time, as we were flying to Iceland that afternoon so went back to Lauren&amp;#39;s for lunch.
Lauren let us know that she thought daylight savings was coming in that day, so we checked to make sure we weren&amp;#39;t going to be an hour late for our flight, but it actually changed 3am the following morning. Daylight savings is &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=br0NW9ufUUw&quot;&gt;a stupid system&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, I don&amp;#39;t get why people like it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got a bus to Clapham Junction, and got our first normal train to Gatwick airport.
The flight was actually really cool, I had a window seat and we got to see some cool cities from above.
Flying over Scotland and Isle of Skye was also cool, we could see all the rolling hills of the highlands, some of  which still had snow on them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/dover/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dover&#x2F;IMG_0852.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Cliffs&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren has a car so we thought we would take advantage of it and do a day trip somewhere she hadn&amp;#39;t been yet, so headed to see the White Cliffs of Dover and Dover Castle. I was surprised how quickly we got to more rural areas, as I was expecting heaps of urban sprawl like Brisbane, but London is actually pretty contained.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to ignore the National Trust tourist part and headed further up towards the St Margaret&amp;#39;s Bay end where we hoped there would be less people. The cliffs were really awesome, they looked like they were made of chalk and where we went there was no fences just walking tracks and then edge. The walk from the road where we parked was also nice with a bit of forest with wildflowers and some abandoned buildings. It was also cool driving in and seeing the harbor which had lots of massive ships coming and going.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dover&#x2F;IMG_0862.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Cliffs&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we went to look at &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.english-heritage.org.uk&#x2F;visit&#x2F;places&#x2F;dover-castle&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Dover Castle&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which was even a cool drive in as we had to drive under a medieval archway. The ticket price was pretty expensive but it was a massive grounds and had heaps of things to see.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we did a tour of underground war hospital. The small amount of the tunnels we saw was pretty extensive and hard to imagine from above. Living down there during the war would have been pretty horrible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dover&#x2F;IMG_0924.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Castle%20Grounds&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dover&#x2F;IMG_20170324_124532.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Underground%20war%20hospital&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a display about some of the various wars between France and how the ownership of the castle had changed, but the highlight by far was the actual castle itself. It was massive and had heaps of little side tunnels and staircases which were almost all open to walk through. They had some displays set up to show how it would have been furnished in the day also. It was interesting how small the beds were because they slept sitting up due to the smoke making it hard to breathe lying down.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also cool was the medieval tunnels, which went pretty deep into the ground and were impressive fortifications for the time. We had not expected to stay long but there was so many things to see we were there for hours. The 2,000 year old &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dubris#Lighthouses&quot;&gt;Roman Lighthouse&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was crazy to think it was still standing, and the Roman Church was also pretty cool.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dover&#x2F;IMG_0938.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Roman%20Church&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went into town to get some lunch, but the town itself wasn&amp;#39;t that great. It was a bit smelly and nothing particularly interesting to see.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/more-london/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;more-london&#x2F;towerbridge.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Tower%20Bridge&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some sleep, we headed back out to explore some more of London.
The beautiful weather from the previous day had ended and we got some of the London weather we were expecting in the form of cold miserable light rain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up we went to see Tower of London and Tower Bridge. We were planning to go inside but the tickets were about $50 AUD each, so we thought we&amp;#39;d find something a bit cheaper to do.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to go check out Greenwich, so we tried to get a boat up the River Thames, but we didn&amp;#39;t have enough credit on our oyster cards and you couldn&amp;#39;t top them up at the ferry terminal. So we got a train there instead. We quickly stopped by the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cutty_Sark&quot;&gt;Cutty Sark&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; ship on the way also.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a beautiful area (despite the weather) and we really enjoyed the tour of the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Royal_Observatory,_Greenwich&quot;&gt;Royal Observatory&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. They had lots of old clock designs and talked about the history of improving navigation on the seas and ways to calculate latitude and longitude.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;more-london&#x2F;greenwich.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Greenwich&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;more-london&#x2F;prime-meridian.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Prime%20Meridian&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Greenwich we headed to Leicester Square and had a very rushed lunch at Chinatown before Rachael and I went to go see the Book of Mormon (which was awesome).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;more-london&#x2F;mormon.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Book%20of%20Mormon&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the show we had a look around some of the shops while we waited for Lauren to come meet us again, particularly cool was the Lego Store.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;more-london&#x2F;lego.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Lego%20Store&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We noticed that there were a heap of choppers flying around so looked on the news that there had been &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2017_Westminster_attack&quot;&gt;an attack&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; at Westminster (lucky for us that we had gone the day before).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;more-london&#x2F;choppers.jpg&quot; title=&quot;lots%20of%20choppers&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dinner we were meeting Rachael&amp;#39;s cousin and his partner at &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thealchemist.uk.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;The Alchemist&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cgpgrey.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-secret-city-of-london.html&quot;&gt;City of London&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which took a while to get to as the traffic was pretty crazy. It wasn&amp;#39;t so bad for Rachael and I though as it gave us more time to sightsee on the bus. After dinner, we went up to the Sky Bar which had a free lift to the top and had great views of the city and a band.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;more-london&#x2F;alchemist.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Drink%20at%20The%20Alchemist&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;more-london&#x2F;skybar.jpg&quot; title=&quot;View%20from%20Sky%20Bar&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we went in for lunch at the Borough Markets, which was like any international food market, except with a few different ones to what we are used to in Australia (such as Ethopian).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here we made our way along the river towards Shakespeare&amp;#39;s Globe, which wasn&amp;#39;t super exciting from the outside. Along the way I thought the ruins of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.english-heritage.org.uk&#x2F;visit&#x2F;places&#x2F;winchester-palace&quot;&gt;Winchester Palace&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; were pretty cool.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;more-london&#x2F;winchester-palace.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Winchester%20Palace&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;more-london&#x2F;globe.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Shakespeare%20Globe&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came across the TATE modern art museum, which was full of weird modern art. GOMA in Brisbane is
way better in my opinion. There was a nice view from the top of the building though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;more-london&#x2F;tate-modern-roof.jpg&quot; title=&quot;TATE%20Modern%20Roof&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That afternoon we just chilled at Lauren&amp;#39;s and then went to one of her local pubs the Crab Tree. There was an open mic night with a few good bands, although I didn&amp;#39;t think food was very good. They also had posters for &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Boat_Race&quot;&gt;a boat race&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; the next weekend between Oxford and Cambridge which apparently is a big deal.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/first-day-in-london/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;first-day-in-london&#x2F;laurens3.jpg&quot; title=&quot;View%20of%20the%20street&quot; alt=&quot;street&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first stop in our Europe trip was to London to visit Rachael&amp;#39;s sister Lauren.
So after a Uber to the bus station, a bus to Brisbane, a long flight to Bangkok, a long boring layover and then an even longer flight to London, we arrived at Heathrow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren met us at arrivals and then we got our first tube ride to Hammersmith and then a bus to her place. Her place was pretty cool and very stereotypical of what you would expect in London, with a very steep staircase and a cupboard under the stairs. It was a lovely day and all the trees in her street were in flower also.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;first-day-in-london&#x2F;laurens1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Terraced%20house&quot; alt=&quot;house&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;first-day-in-london&#x2F;laurens2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Cupboard%20under%20the%20stairs&quot; alt=&quot;cupboard&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we had unpacked and had a chance to catch up, Rachael and I got the tube to Kensington to find a Three Store and get a cheap SIM so we would have data on our trip (the plan had free roaming in the other countries we were going to). From there we were headed to the museums but walked through Hyde Park on the way (looking at a map now it was technically Kensington Gardens).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;first-day-in-london&#x2F;hyde1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hyde park&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;first-day-in-london&#x2F;hyde2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hyde park&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were not expecting to seen anything like the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Albert_Memorial&quot;&gt;Albert Memorial&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which was enormous and the gold was extremely bright in the sun. And it was opposite the awesome-looking Royal Albert Hall, which I had heard of but didn&amp;#39;t realise it was opposite a park or a giant gold statue.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;first-day-in-london&#x2F;hyde3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hyde park&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here we walked past lots of embassy buildings to go see the Natural History Museum. This is actually a building that we knew looked awesome, except the front entrance was blocked off and under renovations and so we couldn&amp;#39;t actually see it. Inside was pretty cool, although we had higher expectations and it wasn&amp;#39;t that different to other museums really, just a lot larger.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;first-day-in-london&#x2F;lion.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;lion&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we wanted to go to the science museum, but between the two we quickly popped into the Victoria museum which had Raphael posters which were &amp;#39;on loan from Her Majesty the Queen&amp;#39;. You would think it would just be donated to the museum, but good you could seem the for free. Rachael liked all the old clothes which were the majority of the displays.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite place was the Science museum. It had heaps of cool displays especially the space exhibits and large projected globe with various satellite imagery.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;first-day-in-london&#x2F;science1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;museum&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;first-day-in-london&#x2F;science2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;museum&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the museums we met back up with Lauren at Hyde Park. From there it was a short walk to Buckingham palace and Trafalgar square. It was really crazy how close all the main sights are to each other, and how close Lauren was staying to the city also.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;first-day-in-london&#x2F;queen.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;queen&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had lunch and then walked to Westminster to see Big Ben and parliament.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;first-day-in-london&#x2F;westminster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;westminster&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we got home I was wrecked from not sleeping in about 2 days, so Rachael and Lauren want to get some fish and chips for dinner but I fell asleep.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-luzern/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-luzern&#x2F;p1050200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Luzern&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our trip to Luzern marked Rachael&amp;#39;s first journey in a double-decker train, and we got to see some Swiss countryside on the way. I originally had planned for us to go the top of Mt. Pilatus, but when I checked the site in the morning it said the cable cars weren&amp;#39;t running, so we gave up on that idea. Also for some reason my bank card wasn&amp;#39;t working, so I couldn&amp;#39;t get out anymore money so we had to make do with the amount of cash I already had on me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachael was blown away by the snow-capped mountains that surround the city, and I must say they were quiet awesome. Having been in Switzerland for 4 months now, they have lost some of their first impact, but I can still very much appreciate the view. On the train, there was kids with placards saying &amp;quot;Run Daddy, Run&amp;quot; and it turns out that there was another marathon taking place!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We watched the marathon for a bit, as it&amp;#39;s quite interesting just how diverse a range of people competed. There were old and young, couples and groups, even a blind guy and a guy in a roman outfit, complete with shield.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I text Petr, who lives in Luzern and he came down to give us a tour of the city. &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chapel_Bridge&quot;&gt;The Kapellbrücke&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the most famous part of the town. What is most interesting was that there was a fire a few years ago, and so now the artwork up top is now just black.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My highlight of the trip was the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lion_Monument&quot;&gt;Lion Monument&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. This was a statue that was carved into the side of a cliff. Petr said it is the &amp;quot;saddest statue in the world&amp;quot; according to some actor that he had forgotten the name of. I think it was definitely the coolest statue I have seen so far, better by far then the ones in the Louvre.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-luzern&#x2F;P1050204.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this we went up to the old city wall, where you can climb the towers. Inside the tower you can see the workings of the clock, which involved a massive rock tied to a pendulum. We just so happened to be in the tower at 2:00 when the bell went off, ensuring that we will now go deaf one year earlier. Even more impressive was that daylight savings had just kicked in, and as there was no electric parts on the clock we couldn&amp;#39;t work out how it knew how many times to ring. Somebody must have gone round to all the clocks that morning to put them all forward an hour.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then made our way back to the lake to buy some food and drinks and take in the view. Rachael is a hater of beer so I thought I would get her to try some of the very different tasting varieties available in Europe, which taste wildly different to any beer I have had in Australia, and so I thought she might enjoy them. But be it wheat or tequila, Rachael likes neither. At least she gave it a go.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This basically brings us to the end of the trip. The next day I showed Rachael around Turgi, where I live and work and we walked to the nearby town of Baden, where she got to pat a sheep. Then she had to leave and I had to go back to work. It is a little sad, but at least I still have snow to look forward to... it&amp;#39;s getting colder by the day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-schloss-neuschwanstein/">&lt;p&gt;After a few quick hours of sleep in Munich, we were checking out again. At the train station we waited for the tour to start, and then after seeing a sign for the Neuschwanstein Tour, signed up. Turns out it was the wrong one, and not the Sandeman&#x27;s one that we had to planned to go on. Our guide was perfectly good though, and in fact probably needed the money more as the other group was much bigger and there was only 2 other people with us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to get our train to Füssen only to find that the train had been cancelled, so instead we had to get a bus. So we got a bus, changed to a train, changed to another train then another train, then another bus until finally we were there only one hour later than planned. The view on the way was great, lots of green countryside and forests with random patches of snow the closer we got.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the woman at the tourist office was nice enough to let us leave our luggage, we journeyed onward to look up at Hohenschwangau Castle, which was the original royal castle &#x2F; holiday house.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-schloss-neuschwanstein&#x2F;hohenschwangau.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Rachael got to play in the snow a bit, and throw some snowballs (strangely she didn&amp;#39;t throw any at me, was totally expecting it and would have been fine with it - you missed your chance!) we got a bus up to Marys Bridge. From here we got to see the waterfall and the castle.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The castle was epic in every sense of the word. Ludwig was clearly a crazy maniac, he had a room dedicated to the swan and there was a room that was a man-made cave. It actually felt like you were in a cave and the doors had rocks on the back so you really wouldn&amp;#39;t know otherwise. What a nutter. Wikipedia has a good article on the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Neuschwanstein_Castle&quot;&gt;Neuschwanstein Castle&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we were an hour late coming in, we didn&amp;#39;t get to go down to the lake which was a shame but better than missing our train home. Apparently one of the lakes was the lake that the opera &amp;quot;Swan Lake&amp;quot; is named after.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-schloss-neuschwanstein&#x2F;lake.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the train back to Buchloe heard the various story&amp;#39;s of Ludwig&amp;#39;s death, because he died under &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ludwig_II_of_Bavaria#Mysterious_death&quot;&gt;Mysterious Circumstances&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&amp;quot;. We asked our guide what they do in Buchloe and he said &amp;quot;make supercars&amp;quot;. Apparently he was hitch-hiking from Berlin and the CEO of the company picked him up in one of the cars and offered to take him to Munich. He said it&amp;#39;s normally like an 8 hours journey, but they did it in 3. No speed limit on the autobahn means they were travelling 300km&#x2F;h or so for most of the journey.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our train home was okay, we got to talk to a girl from America that was a screenwriter and was writing a movie. We had a pretty interesting conversation to say the least, and she had a very different personality to anyone I&amp;#39;ve met before.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on the way into Switzerland, two guys from customs came through with a sniffer dog and spent ages going through this lady&amp;#39;s bag. He then checked our passports and such and I think Rachael was a little freaked out because she didn&amp;#39;t know what was going (they were mostly speaking in German and were in street clothes). We changed trains at Winterthur and met some Aussie students, one of them was doing engineering. The train also started to fill with people coming and going from the clubs in Zürich, as it was a Saturday night which always makes for an interesting train ride. At long last we made it home (or to Switzerland in Rachael&amp;#39;s case) and got some sleep before yet more travel the next day. Oh and because I didn&amp;#39;t have any food at home except Chocolate, and the shops are closed at that time, we got to have that for tea. Rachael very much approved of the chocolate, but I think not so much about having it as a meal.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-summary-and-tips/">&lt;p&gt;This final Euro Trip post (before we get back to Switzerland) is to sum up my impressions of each city. In particular it is dedicated to Tim and Kate who might be coming over next year, or anyone else that plans on travelling to Europe in the future. Hopefully these tips&#x2F;comments will be able to make your trip even more enjoyable than ours.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;places&quot;&gt;Places&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rome&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - Rome as a place to visit is a must. There is so much history and places to see that it&#x27;s somewhere everywhere should go once. Having been once, I don&#x27;t think I will go back but a one time visit is essential. The two highlights were the Colosseum&#x2F;Forum Tour and the Vatican Museum.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found Rome to be a fairly dirty&#x2F;unfriendly&#x2F;busy city. People I talked to (both before going and after) were divided: 50% agreed that it was a yucky city, while 50% thought it was superb. So this indicates to me that it all depends on what areas you visit, as I had a bad first impression, but found the touristy areas nice. Make sure you find some good accommodation even if it&#x27;s a bit more expensive. The hostel we stayed at &quot;Hostel Roma Downtown&quot; wasn&#x27;t very good, but we heard that the other ones are even worse so make sure you read some reviews before staying anywhere.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Florence&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - Florence was a magnificent city, and the hostel we stayed at &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.academyhostel.eu&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Academy Hostel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&quot; was great, we even got some free pasta for dinner. Make sure you visit the gardens and the duomo, and maybe some museums if you are into that sort of thing. There wasn&#x27;t a great deal of things to see and do, so you probably don&#x27;t want more than 2 days.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venice&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - For some reason the reception at our hotel &quot;Residence Al Carmini&quot; was only open from 9 - 2 each day, and when we were there at 9 one morning there was nobody there, so I don&#x27;t think even that is truthful. It made leaving luggage and checking out a big hassle, so make sure you check when reception is open in advance for any of the places that you stay at.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paris&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - Paris was Rachael and I&#x27;s favourite city and two days was not enough. I think you would need about a week to see it properly. The hostel we stayed at &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.st-christophers.co.uk&#x2F;paris-hostels&quot;&gt;St. Christopher&#x27;s Hostel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&quot; was excellent and I highly recommend it. You probably don&#x27;t need to plan anything in advance, just see what takes your fancy each day. In particular we got told that there are always concerts and shows going on, and if there are still seats left an hour before the show then they sell them for only $10 each.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prague&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;- Prague was a lovely city, and the food and drinks were so cheap. If you have time, maybe leave the city and go to somewhere nearby as it will get cheaper still and I&#x27;m sure is just as nice. The &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.plusprague.com&quot;&gt;Plus Hostel Prague&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&quot; was pretty good, as was the 5 star place we stayed at &quot;Hotel Pariz&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuschwanstein Castle&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - This castle screams &quot;massive waste of money&quot; in every single way, but it has turned out pretty well in the long-term, as once the king died they opened it up to tourists and now make 0.25mil euro a day. Well worth a visit at least once just to see how stupidly extravagant it is. The view from the castle is great as well, with lots of lakes and the Austrian alps surrounding it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tours&quot;&gt;Tours&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best tours in Europe are by far the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.neweuropetours.eu&#x2F;&quot;&gt;NewEurope&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; tours. In fact I reckon that you could probably book a holiday of Europe just around these tours and it would be epic, I will probably do this if I come back, try to go on each one. They also have paid tours and pub crawls as well, which we didn&#x27;t have time for.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hop-on Hop-off bus tour in Rome was great because everything was so close and it made travel convenient, but not as convenient in Paris because everything was so far apart. The Paris metro was cheap and easy so I would probably suggest this as a better option to travel. The actual &quot;tour&quot; part (in the form of the audio guides) was pretty dull for both though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skip-the-line tours are great, the Vatican would have sucked without it because the line was huge and by paying for the tour you get in straight away. The tour itself was pretty good, nothing exceptional but definitely better than navigating the place by yourself. The Colosseum skip-the-line tour was also great. We found it by accident as they were selling tickets out the front, but I recommend paying the extra 10 euro or so over lining up, and you get a guide!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the paid walking tours that we did were horrible and I would recommend against them. The one in Venice was an exception because of the Gondola tour, but the tour itself wasn&#x27;t too bad either.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;language&quot;&gt;Language&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to learn some basic words in the language, especially for Paris. I&#x27;ve always heard about how rude people are there, but as long as you open with &quot;Bonjour, Parlez vous Anglais?&quot; the seemed to be nice enough. That goes for all the places, you don&#x27;t need to speak the language, but at least learn Hello and Thankyou. This was pretty easy for everywhere but Prague, because they have some russian looking letters and we had no idea how to pronounce it. But we asked someone and &quot;Ahoy&quot; is the informal way to say both hello and goodbye, so just pretend that you are a pirate and they might understand you. Most people speak at least some basic English in Europe so we had no problems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;other&quot;&gt;Other&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring your student ID card. Rachael didn&#x27;t for some reason so she had to pay full price at some places. They might not recognise Oz ID&#x27;s everywhere, but so far I haven&#x27;t had any problems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-praha/">&lt;p&gt;Due to our delayed flight from France, we got into Prague later than we were supposed to. By the time we found our Hostel we had 30 mins to get to the walking tour we had booked. We asked at reception how long it would take to get there and got told about 30 mins. So we made a mad rush, but got the tram in the wrong direction, got a bit lost and went to a Mexican restaurant instead.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got some traditional Czech cuisine in the form of roasted duck with red cabbage and dumplings. Rachael got a shot of tequila. Actually she got a meal as well, but as alcohol is cheap as in Prague, she was very excited about the drinks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that has confused me a lot here is the whole tipping procedure. Our bill had a place where you wrote how much you wanted to tip, but we weren&#x27;t sure what you are supposed to give so we gave 10%. In Venice they didn&#x27;t even ask, we just got charged 15% on top of the total added at the bottom of the bill (which seemed a bit dodgy). I much prefer it in Australia where you don&#x27;t have to worry about these things.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the hostel we had 2 free beers as a welcome gift at the hostel bar, so we went to enjoy those (well I did) and Rachael tried some more shots. The bar guys were getting right into it, dancing like mad and cranking the music. It was a bit out-of-place considering there was only 3 people in the bar besides Rachael and I, and they were all on the computers using Facebook.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On DAY 2 we swapped over to our 5 star Hotel. It was very fancy, and we even had a porter take our luggage upstairs for us, but I have a feeling that a 5 star Hotel in Australia would have been a bit better. We weren&#x27;t complaining though, after some of the places we had stayed at in Italy we were living in luxury - although it&#x27;s a bit of a waste of money because we didn&#x27;t spend much time at the Hotel with so much to see in only 2 days.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring the old town, we were lucky enough to arrive during a food festival with food markets everywhere with all kinds of different foods we hadn&#x27;t seen before. Everything was cooked on an open fire in front of you and it had an amazing atmosphere to it, I&#x27;m hoping that is what the Christmas markets will be like here in December.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-praha&#x2F;foodfestival.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After exploring the city a bit by ourselves, we went on the free walking tour for Prague. Like the previous tours, the tour was excellent and we got to hear lots of interesting stories about the city. We got to visit the Louvre again, or at least the building that was supposed to be the Louvre in the movie &amp;quot;Euro Trip&amp;quot;. Lots of movies are apparently filmed in Prague because everything is so cheap there. There was lots of other cool stories and places to see, and the history of Czech Republic itself was quite interesting as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-praha&#x2F;clock.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the tour we had some dinner, this time I got a porkknuckle, but it wasn&amp;#39;t as epic as the one I had in Munich. The dumpling was a bread one as well, so not as cool as the potato one I had at Augustiner. I had a beer which was called a semi-dark beer. Petr told me later that it&amp;#39;s actually a dark beer and a light beer mixed together. Rachael got some Goulash, which was also nice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having missed our paid tour the night before, Rachael rang up and we were able to go on a different tour the next night. Worst. Tour. Ever. We met the lady at Charles Bridge for the tour, and it was just us and a Japanese couple. She told us we would quickly meet her friend at the other side of the bridge, which turned out to be her date, who we suspect was a bit drunk. The actual tour itself was quite nice I suppose, we got a train up to the top of the hill and then walked through a nice park down towards Prague castle. It was a nice area and a nice walk. As far as the tour was concerned though, we didn&amp;#39;t learn too much. The information we did gain came about through questions we asked her, but besides answering our questions she wasn&amp;#39;t very forthcoming with information.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On DAY 3 we got to experience a 5 star breakfast, and it was indeed the best breakfast of the trip. It was basically on par with the breakfast I got at Hamilton Island one time, but after the breakfasts we&amp;#39;d had at previous places it was truly unbelievable. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve ever had banana cake for breakfast before. After breakfast, we walked up the hill to visit Prague Castle.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prague Castle - it looks epic from down at the city looking up at it. So imagine how cool it actually must be to walk up and go inside - it was .... meh. The church was cool but after being to the Vatican it was rather dull. There was an art gallery which was cool, but after being to the Louvre it was also not that special. The actual castle only had about 3 rooms you could visit and while they were nice, failed to impress us. I think maybe if it had been the first stop on our journey we would have been far more appreciative, but we left a little disappointed at how little there was to see for a ticket that I&amp;#39;m pretty sure cost twice that of the Louvre.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-praha&#x2F;church.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked back down to the city to pick up our luggage, and then found our way to the train station, where we waited for our bus to Nürnberg. The bus ride out of Prague was beautiful, the countryside of Czech Republic was just spectacular. I think it was mostly because of all the autumn leaves adorning the trees, but I am sure it looks pretty good during the rest of the year as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We listened to some Tim Minchin on the bus as we drove along the Autobahn, then got to the town of Nürnberg. If we didn&amp;#39;t have luggage and it wasn&amp;#39;t dark I would have loved to explored, but instead we spent the time waiting for the next train playing Eye-Spy. From here we got an ICE train to Munich. The ICE trains are crazy fast, 269km&#x2F;hr it said it was going on the LED display. And yet it was the quietest and smoothest train we have been on. Pretty impressive.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually we arrived in Munich, and made our way to the Jäger Hostel. At the Jäger Hostel you get a free shot of Jäger, but as it was midnight and we were exhausted, we just went straight to sleep as we had to be up early the next day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-paris/">&lt;p&gt;Coming in on the train in the morning we got to see some epic countryside. France was a lovely country and I want to go back again and see more of it one day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got off our train we needed to catch the Metro to our Hostel. The ticket system sucks. There was only one ticket machine and about 40 people lined up to use it. After we finally got our ticket we were on our way, and despite being very crowded it was pretty convenient and cheap.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as we got there we knew that this Hostel was going to be awesome. And having stayed there I would say it was the best Hostel I have ever been to so far. Only problem is, it&#x27;s a long way from anything interesting, which isn&#x27;t a big deal if you use the Metro, but as we didn&#x27;t really no what we were doing and had a bus tour (but didn&#x27;t know the stops) we started walking to the Louvre and trying to find a bus stop on the way. There was several but they were really badly signed, and we didn&#x27;t find them until later when we had a brochure with all the stops. So we ended up walking to the Louvre.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a lovely walk, but Rachael wasn&#x27;t in a good mood (I think all the walking was starting to get to her) so I don&#x27;t think she enjoyed it. She was much happier once we finally got the Louvre. Well that&#x27;s not true, I said that we were at the Louvre as soon as I saw it but she wouldn&#x27;t beleive me until we walked all the way around to the front entrance which has the glass pyramid. Having talked to someone the next day, this is the worst entrance to go to because it means you have to line up for an hour or so instead of 5mins at a side entrance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-paris&#x2F;louvre2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So having waited in line, we got to go inside. The sheer enormity of the place is incredible. It is huge. I had been told by many people that you need several days to see it all, but we saw most things in 4 hours. And after 4 hours we had well and truly had enough and wanted to leave. Every room had something cool in it, but the place is so huge and there is so much to see I don&amp;#39;t think many people could handle longer than that without becoming exhausted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-paris&#x2F;louvre3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we left, and found our Hop-on Hop-off bus. We spent the rest of the day sitting on it as it slowly took us home. The wind up top was freezing so we had to go downstairs, which was shame because there was so many cool sights. We went up to the top again sometimes for the particularly interesting sections, like the Champs-Élysées and Eiffel Tower, but the cold was pretty offputting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roundabout around the Arc de Triomphe was really crazy, you can understand why it&amp;#39;s not possible to get insurance there, it seemed like madness but there wasn&amp;#39;t any accidents so there must be a fairly good system in place. I am pretty sure that unlike a normal roundabout, people coming onto the roundabout have right-of-way rather than people on the roundabout because we were constantly stopping to let people on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rome it had been great because everything was so close together, but the bus tour of Paris took forevor. By the time we finally got to stop near our Hostel we were freezing and starving. At the stop was a subway so we went in there. They have 15cm and 30cm subs. We were cut. How come Australia has to use the term &amp;quot;footlong&amp;quot; if they don&amp;#39;t. It was also interesting to see how different the food was even though it was the same meals. The chicken fillet looked nothing like our one, and it had vegies and stuff cooked into it as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the hostel we had a second dinner in the form of some Fish and Chips, and a few drinks before heading upstairs to get some sleep.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On DAY 2 we waited at our hostel which was the starting point of the free walking tour. Like the Munich one, the tour was great and we learnt a lot about the city. On the river Seine we got to see some police going scuba diving looking for bodies. Our guide informed us that they were probably checking for suiciders as the bridge is a popular place for that sort of thing. We also got to see a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Invader_%28artist%29&quot;&gt;space invader mosiac&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I had seen a couple in Bern as well, but apperently Paris was the first place where they started appearing, because the guy that does it is French. His most famous one is on the Hollywood sign in America.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-paris&#x2F;spaceinvaders.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We crossed the Pont Neuf (New Bridge) which is the oldest bridge in Paris - it was new at the time of naming obviously. We were shown a spot from the Bourne Identity, and a place which is haunted. We also crossed another bridge later on that had more of the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Love_padlocks&quot;&gt;padlocks&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on it. It&amp;#39;s kind of funny that the government comes through twice a year with bolt cutters to remove them all - kind of defeats the point for people doing it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we had been to the Louvre and some other places that I have probably forgotten, Jenny (our guide) led us to this random place too see some modern art. It was probably the first modern art I have seen that I actually found cool. We were told that the artist beleives that art should be something that you don&amp;#39;t have to pay for, you find unexpectedly and makes you have an oppinion about it (good or bad).... and it was definitetly that. It was called &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.telegraph.co.uk&#x2F;culture&#x2F;art&#x2F;4613494&#x2F;Public-art.html?image=1&quot;&gt;Les Deux Plateaux&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and stripey art dude I salute you for making it, I enjoyed it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-paris&#x2F;modernart.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we went through the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tuileries_Garden&quot;&gt;Tuileries Gardens&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and walked down towards the obelisk and then across the river again to a war museum where the body of Napoleon is kept. Then after the tour some of us went to a french cafe and had some &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Croque-monsieur&quot;&gt;Croquemonsieur&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and wine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our french cafe experience, Rachael and I left and went to see the Eiffel Tower up close, which was kind of cool except for all the guys with machine guns and the hundreds of dodgy guys selling mintature towers. Interestinly we found out there is a single bedroom apartment at the top of the eiffel tower that the designer had installed for himself that he could take &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; to. It would be a pretty impressive pick-up line for sure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that we rode around on the bus a bit, went inside the Cathedral Notre Dame de Paris and watched some street dancers outside.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-paris&#x2F;notredame1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then got the bus to the Champs-Élysées in order to climb to the top of the Arc de Triomph. There was more street dancers there as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{&amp;lt; vimeo 16563098 &amp;gt;}}&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The view from the top at night was spectacular and I reccomend it to everyone. I&amp;#39;m sure it is great in the day but at night the lights of the city were spectacular.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-paris&#x2F;arc1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time we got the metro home instead of the bus, which made the journey much quicker. That is once we worked out where to go, we got a little bit confused. The place is like a giant maze and most of the time we had no idea where we were or how far underground.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On DAY 3 we weren&amp;#39;t quite ready to leave Paris, it was a great city. Nonetheless, we had to check out and get a train to the airport. The whole day was basically wasted, because not only do you have to spend hours waiting at the airport, our plane sat on the tarmac for about another hour before we actually took off, I have no idea why. But eventually we were off and on our way to Prague....&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-venezia/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-venezia&#x2F;p1040894.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Me in Venice&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming into Venice was pretty exciting, especially when the train finally got past the mainland and we were on a bridge, heading out to sea and the island of Venice. My first impression wasn&amp;#39;t that great to be honest, I expected it to be cooler. The view from the train station wasn&amp;#39;t particularly dazzling and it wasn&amp;#39;t until a bit later that we got to see places that were more like my expectations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting around Venice sucks. It is in fact, not actually an island, but rather lots of little islands joined together by bridges. So while our Hotel wasn&amp;#39;t that far from the train station, it was still an effort to get there. When we finally get to the Hotel we find it closed, with a sign out the front saying that reception is only open until 2pm. It&amp;#39;s only 2.10 so we ring the doorbell a few times and eventually someone comes out, lets us in and gives us a key. The hotel itself was great (especially the view out the window of a canal), but the service was ... non-existent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dumping our luggage, the stairs weren&amp;#39;t so frustrating and we got to explore the city. Unfortunately, there isn&amp;#39;t much too it. It&amp;#39;s just shops, shops and more shops. Oh and some B&amp;amp;B&amp;#39;s and Restaurants. Regardless, it&amp;#39;s such a different experience to be somewhere with canals instead of streets so we were content with walking around aimlessly and looking at abandoned buildings that had water lapping against the front doors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-venezia&#x2F;floating-door.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-venezia&#x2F;P1040896.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set out to find a supermarket, but after a lot of looking, we still couldn&amp;#39;t find one. We headed back to the train station in the hope there would be one there, and found a shop inside that had some very pricey pasta and pasta sauce, that would need to do. It was Italian pasta at least. We also bought a bottle of &amp;quot;Grappa&amp;quot; (looked like red wine but with some grapes still in the bottle of the bottle) that was 12 euro and 40% alcohol and came in an awesome looking bottle to go with our meal. We asked the cashier what it tasted like, but she was no help as didn&amp;#39;t speak English. Another lady told us it tasted nothing like red wine but that it was good.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-venezia&#x2F;dinner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After cooking up our epic dinner, we discovered that trying the local cuisine isn&amp;#39;t always a good thing. The pasta was okay, nothing special, but the Grappa was absolutely disgusting. I managed to finish my glass for the sake of not wasting it, but Rachael couldn&amp;#39;t handle more than one sip. Even watering it down didn&amp;#39;t help. We talked to some people about it later, and it turns out that while a lot of Italians do drink it straight, most sane people only use it in cooking. Thanks lady at the shop that said it was nice. Rachael wanted to pour it all down the sink, but we ended it up leaving it in the room and told reception they could have it when we checked out.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On DAY 2 we set out to find St. Marco Square, as we had a walking tour there in the afternoon and had no idea where it was. The city is like a maze, and eventually we found it after heading who knows where on the island. Luckily there was lots of cool things to see on the way, such as areas of the island that were flooded because it was high-tide. The actual square itself was flooded too when we found it, and it appeared like the church would be too, but when we went back that afternoon we saw that it was designed a bit better so the entrance was higher than the water level and acted as a barrier to stop it coming in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-venezia&#x2F;flood1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-venezia&#x2F;flood2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stumbled across a supermarket at last, and got some MUCH cheaper pasta and some wine that was in English and we knew we would like. Rachael was over the trying Italian wine phase until I showed her the prices, at which point she quickly changed her mind. It took ages to get home as the city really is a maze, and there is no such things as shortcuts because most streets come to dead-ends if there isn&amp;#39;t a bridge to let you cross at the end, making our attempt at shortcuts into massive detours.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our attempt at home-cooked Italian cuisine was much better this time, and the pasta was delicious. More walking BACK to the square afterwards for our walking tour made us pretty excited for the opportunity to sit and a Gondola and do nothing. The walking tour was fairly interesting, but there wasn&amp;#39;t a whole lot to see besides a cool looking spiral staircase building. We learnt a few things about the island though, most important being that basically nobody lives there anymore, it&amp;#39;s just full of tourists. All the locals moved out to neighboring islands and just come in for work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-venezia&#x2F;staircase.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gondola ride at the end of our tour was great, it started off boring as we went along for a bit in the sea first, but once we were going through all the little canals it was really cool. We then had to walk back to our hotel yet again, and I think Rachael worked it out later that we did about 16km of walking that day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-venezia&#x2F;gondola.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{&amp;lt; vimeo 16560337 &amp;gt;}}&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On DAY 3 we had to walk to the Square yet again to go on a Boat trip to 3 of the surrounding islands. While we were waiting they were setting up for the Venice marathon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first island we went to was Murano, where we got to see how glass was made. It was incredible to watch and I had no idea how much skill would be needed to do it. Check out the video of the guy making a horse sculpture.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{&amp;lt; vimeo 16560205 &amp;gt;}}&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next stop was to Burano, which is famous for lace making. Unlike glass making, lace is really boring. The island itself was still pretty cool though as all the houses were painted different bright colours. We saw a church tower that was leaning, and discovered that in the absence of having cars, the young hooligans put the fully sick sub-woofers in their boats. It was strange situation in which we heard the doof doof of a Kate Perry song as some young guy drove past in his tinny.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-venezia&#x2F;Burano.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third island was Torcello, which we had been warned by our walking tour guide the day before was a boring, ugly island... and indeed it was.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we came back the marathon was on, but we didn&amp;#39;t have time to watch as we had to race back the hotel and grab our luggage. Luckily we got back just on 2, and were able to grab our stuff. I still think that it&amp;#39;s crazy that there would only be someone there until 2 in the afternoon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took our luggage to the train station and paid to have them stored there so we didn&amp;#39;t have to carry them around, and set out to find some food. We saw a sign for McDonalds and thought it would be a good place to spend a while without getting kicked out but spent ages looking and never found it. It then started to rain so we went to another restaurant, had some lunch then went back to the train station. It continued to rain and be freezing as we waited a few hours for our train. Our train was meant to leave at 7 but we stayed in the station for a good hour or so due to &amp;quot;technical difficulties&amp;quot; before finally leaving Italy behind and heading onward to Paris.....&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start our story of Florence at first with the train journey. We got to meet a diverse range of people during the trip. Immediately opposite Rachael and I was a British couple. I don&amp;#39;t think I heard the girl say a word during the whole journey. She sat there for the whole trip with headphones in ear, basically ignoring our existence. The guy was a polar opposite, extremely chatty and engaged us in conversation for the entire trip. They were headed to Venice so that he could compete in the Venice Marathon, and like us, where stopping at Florence on the way. It was a fairly interesting conversation, one point worth mentioning was &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.signonsandiego.com&#x2F;uniontrib&#x2F;20060917&#x2F;news_1t17castle.html&quot;&gt;a castle he told us&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; about that is being built in France. Also on the train, was a bishop from Australia, who had been in Rome to see the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.abc.net.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;stories&#x2F;2010&#x2F;10&#x2F;18&#x2F;3040655.htm&quot;&gt;canonization of Mary MacKillop&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I think the fact that we were Australian&amp;#39;s in Rome in that week made him assume we were on a Pilgrimage or something, because he asked if we knew some priest-guy from Rocky (who Rachael actually did). We were also stumped by questions he had about Australian news, which I have only vaguely been keeping up with and Rachael had been busy studying for exams. As such we left a very bad impression of our awareness of current affairs. The countryside we went past was also lovely, so all in all it was a pleasant journey and we were glad to be leaving Rome.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived in Florence, we immediately agreed that the city was much nicer. The streets were cleaner, less crowded and there was just a generally better atmosphere. Our hostel was much nicer, and directly opposite the massive Cathedral in the centre of the city.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked around the city for a bit, and found ourselves at the massive &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Boboli_Gardens&quot;&gt;Boboli Gardens&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. After Rachael eventually convinced me to part with 10 euro to get into the gardens we had a wonderful time exploring the absolutely massive grounds filled with random statues and trees that we had never seen before. There was some that looked like gum trees (but weren&amp;#39;t obviously), and we even found olive trees and a tree that had dropped walnuts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-firenze&#x2F;gardens.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For DAY 2 we had a walking tour booked, which was okay but nothing special. In the morning there was an absolutely freezing wind and so a lot of the tour was spent trying to find a spot in the sun along the way. We saw everything we had seen the day before again, but learnt a little bit of history about them this time. After seeing the replica of the Statue of David for the 2nd time on the tour, we didn&amp;#39;t see the need to pay to go inside and see the original when it finished, so we instead decided to pay to climb to the dome of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Florence_Cathedral&quot;&gt;the Duomo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-firenze&#x2F;bridge.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The painting on the inside of the Dome was amazing, and it was incredible how much detail went into a painting so high off the floor. The parts of the painting in heaven was pretty boring but the drawings of what happened to people in hell was intense and pretty funny.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-firenze&#x2F;dome.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Rachael may have some sort of heart condition, because she was basically dead by the time we got to the top (to be fair it was 463 stairs), but once she had recovered we got to take in the magnificent view of the city. The railing&#x2F;fence appeared to be a fairly new addition, so whoever built the cathedral was clearly crazy and had a death wish, as it is a long way up. Who knows how many people must have died to build it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-firenze&#x2F;view.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, there wasn&amp;#39;t anything particularly exciting in Florence, but it had a nice atmosphere and cool buildings and we found it to be much more enjoyable than Rome.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning were back at the train station, waiting to head onwards to Venice.......&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-milano/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-milano&#x2F;p1040765.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Milan&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Euro Trip started in Turgi on Saturday morning... and it was raining and cold. Got a train to Zürich where it was also raining, and waited for my train to Milan.
Once on the train things got better, and eventually we got away from the rain and up into the Alps. I was sitting next to a lady from Berlin and her daughter and they were pretty cool to talk to. The girl didn&amp;#39;t speak very good English, and I don&amp;#39;t speak very good German so we got to have some not very good conversations, but it was pretty fun.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to see the second Swiss person give the finger in my travels. This guy on the train didn&amp;#39;t have a ticket (I think that&amp;#39;s what was happening - they were arguing in Italian) so the ticket lady had this argument with him, which really escalated and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure she told him she had called the police to get him at the next station. Then at the next station they both got off and she gave him the finger and he walked away. I think it was the first sort of argument&#x2F;fight I have seen in Switzerland, although we were basically in Italy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also crazy was the noticeable difference from the Swiss side of the border to the Italian side. Basically on the Swiss side there was small, quaint, neat houses and then 3 mins later as we crossed the border there was derelict rundown Italian buildings covered in graffiti that appeared to have been neglected for the last 10 years or so. It was just so striking how close the two towns were but how different they looked.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same can&amp;#39;t be said for Milan. The &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Milano_Centrale_railway_station&quot;&gt;train station&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in Milan was epic. It had massive ceilings with large stone columns, and was just generally an impressive building.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the train station was a different matter, and stepping outside you could see that Milan was a modern city. It was basically like the city centre of Brisbane, lots of skyrises and nothing particularly cool to see. After spending what was probably a good hour or so finding a map, I worked out which way the Duomo was and headed towards it. It wasn&amp;#39;t that far to walk, but with luggage with me it was a very annoying walk. I hadn&amp;#39;t done any research on Milan so didn&amp;#39;t really know what I was looking for, but walked into the &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Galleria_Vittorio_Emanuele_II&quot;&gt;Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&amp;quot; which had a massive glass dome roof. Then out into the plaza which had the craziest looking church, the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Milan_Cathedral&quot;&gt;Duomo di Milano&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Again, having luggage ruined the experience because I wasn&amp;#39;t allowed inside the church with it. But it was still cool to see from the outside. Then I went for a further walk and found the &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Castello_Sforzesco&quot;&gt;Castello Sforzesco&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&amp;quot; which was pretty cool, but again it was hard to explore and look around too much with a suitcase with me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage it looked like it was going to rain and would get dark soon, so I started heading back to the train station. At one point a police chase went past, maybe they were chasing the mafia... there was about 4 or 5 cop cars with sirens blaring. It started raining basically as I got there at about 6.30pm, and then later on started pouring. It then got really cold once it got dark and I had to put on my new ski jacket that I bought, but even then it was still freezing. So then I had to wait in the cold train station for 6 hours or so for my train to Rome and the train station seemed a lot less awesome then when I first got there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting thing happened at about 10. I&amp;#39;m not sure what exactly was going on, but I walked past this homeless guy on the ground that was going crazy on an umbrella, bending all the metal rods and snapping them. Everybody nearby then grabbed there umbrellas and left. So I&amp;#39;m not sure if it was his or someone else&amp;#39;s. Was bizarre to watch, but I then left as well because this guy was clearly one angry homeless dude.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the train finally boarded, I was pretty impressed that we actually got a sort of bed. The seat rests had been folded back and a sheet put down so the 3 seats became a bed, and another bed was folded down up top. Then some creepy looking Mexican guy came in and I was reminded of the scene on the train in the movie Euro Trip and got a little concerned. But then I think he either was in the wrong compartment or didn&amp;#39;t have a ticket because when the ticket inspector came around he left (they were talking in Spanish or Italian so I didn&amp;#39;t know what exactly was going on). Then a young Swiss&#x2F;Italian guy came in who was pretty cool and I had a chat to him. The actual trip itself was okay, not amazing because it&amp;#39;s hard to sleep on a train when it bumps around and makes so much noise, but was certainly a good way to travel that saves on accommodation and time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then basically slept until I got to Rome........&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2010/euro-trip-roma/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-roma&#x2F;p1040803.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rome&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after waking up and waiting for the train to arrive, we stopped at Roma Tiburtina Station. It was not what I was expecting at all for the capital city of Italy.
The train station had several homeless inhabitants, and smelt a bit funky. My plan had been to walk to Roma Termini Station to meet Rachael about an hour later, but there was no signage as to what direction anything was. After looking around aimlessly the sun finally came up a bit higher, and now knowing which direction was North, I started to head in the general direction of Rachael&amp;#39;s train station.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once away from the train station a bit, I got a better idea of where I was (had a map on my iPod) and managed to find my way to the station with plenty of time to meet Rachael. Once we were reunited, I next task was to find our Hostel. Neither Rachael or I had brought directions, so we were forced to go off my very vague memory that it was only 2 streets from the station, although which streets I couldn&amp;#39;t remember. After walking through several streets with luggage in tow, we FINALLY found our Hostel and were able to dump our gear. By the time we had carried our luggage up the two flights of stairs to reception, Rachael had almost had a heart attack and died. We used the lift from then on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our luggage no longer in the way, we set out to explore the city. Around each new corner we would find something interesting and old-looking to discover and after walking past a couple of ruins we made our way towards the Colosseum and the forum. After a quick look, we decided to come back another day and continued exploring the city on foot, heading towards a field that we later found out was the place where chariot races were held, were there was a festival taking place in which people were re-enacting something and in old-time Roman gear.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stumbled into some &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Santa_Maria_in_Aracoeli&quot;&gt;amazing church&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that was basically all gold (maybe not but it blinded you with extravagance). I wish I could have filmed Rachael&amp;#39;s face as her jaw just dropped and stayed dropped for about 5mins. Then we got an elevator up to the top of the &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Monument_to_Vittorio_Emanuele_II&quot;&gt;Giant White Monstrosity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&amp;quot; which was next door.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-roma&#x2F;church.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More walking around the city, we found somewhere to have lunch. 2 shitty overpriced pizzas later and we continued on our journey, this time walking to the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Trevi_Fountain&quot;&gt;Trevi Fountain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which was a pretty rad fountain that I had never heard of, much to Rachael&amp;#39;s dismay. Apparently it&amp;#39;s in &amp;quot;a million different movies&amp;quot; but I imagine they are mostly all chick-flicks. The area itself was packed with other tourists, and so we left as soon as possible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found near the train station an area where artists were selling paintings, most of which were incredible and we got to see some art for free that was better than most of the stuff we saw in museums.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then went back to our semi-dodgy hostel for some sleep. The room itself was nice, just the fact that the the shower and toilet was in the same cubicle and there idea of &amp;quot;breakfast included&amp;quot; means providing bread and jam every day was dodgy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAY 2 in Rome, we went on a &amp;quot;Hop-on Hop-off Tour&amp;quot; which is a open top bus that drives you around the city. We also took a boat up the river as part of the deal, but it was a pretty boring river really. After getting a glimpse of the front of the Vatican, which still had posters and stuff up from the canonization the day before, we headed back on the bus to visit the Colosseum.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-roma&#x2F;bus.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Colosseum, some lady offered us a skip-the-line tour which we paid for and went on. Our guide was really good and told us all kinds of facts about the games, and related it back to modern times. The actual Colosseum itself is much smaller than I expected, but was still a pretty cool building and must have been incredible back when it was built.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our tour we also got to see the forum, this time with a different guide, who was also good. We learnt that after the Roman Empire fell, the city dropped back to a tiny population and most of the ancient city was used as a dump and buried. When Napoleon came along a few hundred years ago, he saw the top of an arc of triumph that had &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Roman.forum.%26.arch.of.septimius.rome.arp.jpg&quot;&gt;a door cut into it&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and a guy doing haircuts inside. He thought that it was disgusting that the former greatest city in the world had been turned into a dump, and after that they started digging up the city, and what we saw was only 2% of the original city. Most of it is still underground but because they have built on top of it they aren&amp;#39;t allowed to boot people out of their homes on the off chance there is some epic statue underneath it. There was also a church with a floating door that you couldn&amp;#39;t enter, because they built the church on top of an older building and when they dug everything back to the original height and uncovered the building below the door of the church is way higher.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-roma&#x2F;forum.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end the guide told us about a night tour that he was doing, but when we went to the meeting point later he never showed up. So then we just went home. On the way we had another go and trying to get some authentic Italian cuisine and found a nicer looking restaurant where we got some Angry Spaghetti and Quattro Fromage Pizza. Unlike the day before, these tasted pretty amazing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-roma&#x2F;map.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also got the bus past some sort of movie premier for an Italian movie that we had seen lots of posters for, but we didn&amp;#39;t know any of the actors so we didn&amp;#39;t really care.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAY 3 saw us leaving Italy for the morning and entering the Vatican City, which I didn&amp;#39;t realise is actually a country to itself. The &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vatican_Museum&quot;&gt;Vatican museum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was simply incredible, and the reason is that everything cool in Rome was stolen by the church and is in that museum. St Peter&amp;#39;s Basilica is basically ancient Rome because they stole all the expensive marble and gold etc. from the Colosseum and pantheon and what not to build it, which is why the city is now ruins and the forum was turned into a dump. There was rooms and rooms of statues and tapestries and everything you could think of, and every room had incredible artworks on the walls and ceilings, with intricate tile mosaics on the floor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special type of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Porphyry_%28geology%29&quot;&gt;purple marble&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was used for a tonne of Statues, and our guide told us that the Vatican owns something like 90% of of this marble in existence. By far my favourite part of the museum was the Raphael Rooms and in particular, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_School_of_Athens&quot;&gt;this painting&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2010&#x2F;euro-trip-roma&#x2F;vatican.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By DAY 4 we were ready to leave Rome behind, and so after checking out of the Hostel we basically just waited at the train station for 2 hours for our train to Florence...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
