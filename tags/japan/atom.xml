        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/osaka/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2014&#x2F;osaka&#x2F;osake-castle-moat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;osake castle moat&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So leaving Hakuba we got the same local train back towards Matsumoto. From there we went to Nagoya where we got to catch our first Shinkansen (bullet train) to Osaka. It wasn&amp;#39;t as fast as I was expecting (250km&#x2F;h) and was much the same as the ICE train we got in Germany.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first day in Osaka, we went to Kyoto as told in the other post. Before heading back to the hotel we went to one of the shopping centres and on one floor they had &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pokemon.co.jp&#x2F;gp&#x2F;pokecen&#x2F;osaka&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Pokémon Centre&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I thought it might have been interesting, but really it was just a store selling Pokémon Merch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2014&#x2F;osaka&#x2F;pokecentre.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Pok%C3%A9monCentre&quot; alt=&quot;PokémonCentre&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second day we had thought about going to Hiroshima but since it was such a long train ride we decided to check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.peace-osaka.or.jp&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Osaka Peace Museum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; about the war instead. I learnt a lot about WWII that I didn&amp;#39;t know about and the portrayal of what happened reasonably balanced. There was some pretty disturbing photos of malnourished POWs at Changi, it made the TV show seem pretty tame.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we were finished at the museum we went to Osaka Castle in the same grounds. After doing all this boring old people stuff Sarah wanted to go back into the city to go shopping so we did that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;HEP_Five&quot;&gt;HEP Five&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which was a mall with a Ferris Wheel in the middle of it. On the top floor there was an arcade which was very Japanese. They had all these weird photo booths which we weren&amp;#39;t really sure what the point of them (there was lots of them). Eventually worked out they are a thing called &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Photo_booth#Purikura&quot;&gt;Pirukura&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which is a photo booth that does automatic photo shopping and adds items in and such. There was heaps of dressed up girls up there using them, and it was crazy how popular something is that you can probably easily do with the webcam on your computer for free.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the last day everyone wanted to go to the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kaiyukan.com&#x2F;language&#x2F;eng&#x2F;index.htm&quot;&gt;Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I&amp;#39;ve been to a few aquariums recently so wasn&amp;#39;t super excited, but it is one of the largest in the world and they had a whale shark. The whale shark was a bit of a let down though as it was quite small (about the size of some of the larger sharks they have at Sea World), although it makes sense in hindsight as the tank for a full-size one would have to be enormous.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other bad thing about the aquarium was just how packed it was. It was hard to see anything up close just because there was so many people there all fighting to get a good view. It almost felt that there was more room in the tanks (and they were pretty small also). Having said that there was some animals I hadn&amp;#39;t seen before, including one that I hadn&amp;#39;t even heard of before, the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Capybara&quot;&gt;Capybara&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the aquarium our holiday was over, and we got a bus to the Kansai Airport to head back to Australia.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/hakuba/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2014&#x2F;hakuba&#x2F;hakuba.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hakuba&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we were finally off to Hakuba to enjoy the snow that had caused so much dramas. We got an early-ish train from Shinjuku but then had to wait for 2 hours at Shinanoomachi Station for the local train to Hakuba. When we did get to Hakuba we couldn&amp;#39;t find any taxi&amp;#39;s but luckily the hotel was happy to come and pick us all up when we called them. The &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.highmount.com&#x2F;english-highmount&#x2F;e-homepage1.htm&quot;&gt;Hakuba High Mount Hotel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; where we stayed was awesome like that, they had a free shuttle down and back to the Sakka lift every day as well (only a few minute drive).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By coincidence our first night in Hakuba, and my birthday, was Jackson and Bully&amp;#39;s last night in town from their ski trip. So we met at the local pub, &amp;quot;The Pub&amp;quot; for drinks. Was a super fun night and great catching up with them. The rest of the family left reasonable early but Rachael and I stayed until quite late and then walked back up the hill in the snow. Was an excellent finish to my birthday but meant that I was super tired the next day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first day on the slopes was at happo-one as this is where everyone had their lessons. I didn&amp;#39;t do lessons, but stuck close to the green runs they were learning on to see how they were going. It wasn&amp;#39;t a particularly good day as I was tired and trying to keep Mum and Sarah motivated as they weren&amp;#39;t particularly enjoying themselves. Rachael and dad loved it from the start.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second day I took Rachael and Dad up the mountain on a green run and Rachael has a bit of a tantrum when she got stuck in powder as there had been a huge snowfall that night. I tried doing a fun jump I had found the day but just ended up in waist deep powder and had to dig myself out, so we pretty much had to keep to the groomed runs. Mum and Sarah came down about lunch time and had another go but still didn&amp;#39;t enjoy themselves as they hadn&amp;#39;t quite got the hang of it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third day was super windy so some lifts were closed but we got the gondola up and did a higher green run. Rachael didn&amp;#39;t like being close to the cliff, so had another freak out and lost confidence, which was a shame because she had improved heaps until then.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happo-One had a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hakubaconnect.com&#x2F;event&#x2F;414-happo-one-fire-festival&quot;&gt;fire festival&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that night, which we went to get free hot sake (which wasn&amp;#39;t actually hot) and see some fireworks. Unfortunately it was -11 degrees and windy so wasn&amp;#39;t as enjoyable as we had anticipated as we were all freezing. We got to see the bonfire display and some previous olympic skiers come down the mountain, as well as some synchronised skiing which looked awesome. We got too cold and left before the fireworks though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were meant to have a day off to go see the snow monkeys, but yet again too much snow meant that we were trapped in Hakuba as all the roads and trains were closed, and so the tour had been cancelled. This time round things weren&amp;#39;t as bad as we were able to move the skiing forward a day and reschedule. Having accommodation helped as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the last two days we went to Iwatake and the runs were much more fun and easy for mum and Sarah to have another try. This time Sarah got the hang of it and then mostly enjoyed the last two days, although mum still didn&amp;#39;t like skiing. Iwatake has lots more jumps and tree runs for me on the side of the green runs, so I enjoyed it way more than the first 3 days. The fact that everyone had improved and could keep up probably helped as well. The last day was particularly awesome,
as I ditched everyone else for a while and had a few runs smashing down from the top of the gondola to the bottom of the mountain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bully was confident that we would find Hakuba the best snow of anywhere, and I think it was a solid call. I still think Les Diablerets was slightly better, but it was definitely up there. There were plenty of other resorts we didn&amp;#39;t try so I would definitely go back. We had heard good things about Cortina but it was a long bus drive away and we would have missed breakfast. Maybe next time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/japanese-serow/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2014&#x2F;japanese-serow&#x2F;serow.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;serow&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when we were talking to Jackson and Bully at the pub, they told us of how they had seen a sad bear while out snowboarding in one of the further out runs. I didn&amp;#39;t know that Japan had bears so was pretty impressed. Apparently they thought it was a goat at first, but when they got closer decided it was a sad bear. This caused Rachael to freak out a little bit that we would run into a bear and she would be mauled.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, when we saw the trail map for Iwatake they had indications of wild &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Japanese_serow&quot;&gt;Japanese Serow&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; areas, and the picture looked kind of like a goat. So we asked reception at the hotel whether Japan had any bears, and she said no that it definitely would have been a Serow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the snow monkeys they had a hut with stuffed animals, and the above picture is of a stuffed Serow. While not a bear, I still wish I had seen one in the wild.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/jigokudani-monkey-park/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2014&#x2F;jigokudani-monkey-park&#x2F;snow-monkey-sign.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;snow monkey sign&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So our original snow monkey tour was rescheduled to the last day of our stay in Hakuba due to the heavy snow, so we were really lucky we even got to go. It&amp;#39;s a shame because the first part of the bus tour as we were leaving our guide gave an overview of all the different ski resorts and which one was good for different things, something that would have been more useful at the start.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got told a history of the monkey park on the way there. There was a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Onsen&quot;&gt;Onsen&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Lodge (hot springs) in the mountains and the monkey&amp;#39;s made trails along the hot water pipes so they didn&amp;#39;t have to walk in the snow. Eventually one of them must have fallen in or tried the water and they decided they liked spas and took over the lodge. Due to health and safety and the fact people don&amp;#39;t like getting in a spa full of monkey poo, the lodge built a special pool further up the mountain just for the monkeys. A national park was set up with rangers to make sure that the monkeys are not fed by tourists and that they can still live naturally.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snow monkeys were really good, although the hot pool was smaller than I expected. You couldn&amp;#39;t easily get close to the pool because loss of photographers were camped out there hogging it for the entire time. But there was monkeys everywhere throughout the park so it wasn&amp;#39;t too bad. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jigokudani-yaenkoen.co.jp&#x2F;livecam&#x2F;monkey&#x2F;index.htm&quot;&gt;live web cam&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; pointed at the pool.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It smelt of sulphur from the hot pools which wasn&amp;#39;t very pleasant. The monkeys basically ignore humans due to the no feeding rule, which is cool because as our guide said, it&amp;#39;s one of the few places you can watch wild monkeys from so close in their natural habitat.
The rest of the tour was pretty slack, we would have been better of staying at the snow monkey park for longer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch was okay and then we had some free time in the village but it was mostly tourist shops with souvenirs and nothing too exciting. Mum and I did get to eat a marinated locust sample from one of the shops, which was quite tasty actually. You could only taste the sauce but it was very crunchy. The restaurant was the Masuichi-Ichimura Sake Brewery, which was an old Sake Brewery that has been downsized and converted into a restaurant. The food was probably our most authentic Japanese meal, although I didn&amp;#39;t particularly think it tasted that great. The building itself was pretty cool.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final part of the day was to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zenk%C5%8D-ji&quot;&gt;Zenkoji Temple&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The temple we went to was very cool but we were split into two groups and our guide was a volunteer with limited English. He would just point at a statue say the name and then say &amp;quot;follow me to next statue&amp;quot;. This would have been okay if we hasn&amp;#39;t paid so much for the tour, so we were a bit annoyed as we didn&amp;#39;t learn anything. The monkeys only cost $5 entry, but the tour was something like $140, so next time I would just get a hire car for the day and do it that way, as it was a bit of a waste of money. The guide from the company was quite good when we did have him, but the fact that we had paid for a tour and didn&amp;#39;t really get one ruined the experience and I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus ride back was interesting, due to the snow the bus barely fit through some of the streets and we caused a fair bit of traffic congestion and got back to Hakuba fairly late. I probably would have preferred an extra day on the slopes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/kyoto-2/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2014&#x2F;kyoto-2&#x2F;kyoto-gates.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;kyoto gates&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ll jump a head a little bit and talk about our day trip to Tokyo. From Hakuba we got a bullet train to Osaka where we were staying, but the following day we did a day trip to Kyoto while our JR pass was still valid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, we went to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fushimi_Inari-taisha&quot;&gt;Fushimi Inari-taisha&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; a temple built for the Shintu god of rice, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Inari_%C5%8Ckami&quot;&gt;Inari&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It started out a bit disappointing, as it was much like the other temples we had been to... but then it just kept going. There is a walk up the hill to a lookout and there are just gates the whole way, the amount of work that would have been involved is incredible. I really enjoyed it, although I think everyone else was put off by the fact that involved lots of walking up stairs and it really did seem endless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time we had walked back to the bottom, everyone else was tired so it was decided we would go back to main train station to find lunch. I was happy to keep wandering until we found some lunch on the way to the next site but was outvoted. We had a really good lunch, but by the time we got to the next place I wanted to look at, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sanj%C5%ABsangen-d%C5%8D&quot;&gt;Sanjūsangen-dō&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, it was closed. Likewise there was a few museums nearby but they were all closed for renovations as well. I guess winter is not a popular time for tourists so everything shuts early or is just closed in general.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a bit of a bummer and after that we got a train back to Osaka.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/tokyo/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2014&#x2F;tokyo&#x2F;img_20140209_204541.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_20140209_204541&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after our horrible start, things were much better being out of airport and in the city. We stayed at the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;shinjuku.washington-hotels.jp&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Shinjuku Washington Hotel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which was fairly close to the train station and in a good area. The rooms were quite small but had everything you needed, and there was a good view out the window of the government building and the snow-covered streets.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first morning we went to garden nearby and everyone made snowballs and Sarah made a mini snowman. We got wet shoes so we went shopping to department store so Sarah and Mum could get snow shoes. The roof of the shopping centre had awesome views from the top.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At night we went to the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plus.google.com&#x2F;106844401219258713174&quot;&gt;Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; nearby, which has a free lookout at the top that gives you views of the city. We also went there in the daytime, and on a clear day you are meant to be able to see Mt. Fuji, although there was too much cloud when we were there. A cool thing about Tokyo is the underground world, it was possible to walk directly to the building from our hotel and to the train station just using the underpasses and never going above ground.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following night we went to Shibuya, which is the &amp;quot;Times Square&amp;quot; of Tokyo. There was lots happening and it is more what we were expecting of Tokyo based on what you see on TV. We went to a restaurant called Tsukuda Farm. It was really good and had excellent service. We had some marinated raw chicken which tasted awesome (if slimy and chewy) and we didn&amp;#39;t get sick so was all good. One negative was that we got screwed on the bill as we were charged for soup and other entrees we didn&amp;#39;t order and that we thought must have been complimentary. It wasn&amp;#39;t the last time that we would get charged incorrectly (happened a few times during the trip) but the food was quite cheap over there anyway so we didn&amp;#39;t worry about it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went for a day trip into Tokyo to see the Imperial Palace, which was cool but unfortunately you couldn&amp;#39;t get too close and it was also crazy cold. Rachael wanted to see if we could see the ocean, so we walked to a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plus.google.com&#x2F;101249105857747730621&quot;&gt;park on the harbour&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. We had to pay entry to get in (all the other parks were free) but it was really cool. It would be a million times better in the spring as it appeared to have lots of flower fields and cherry blossoms, but everything was just covered in snow for us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the last day we walked to a park near our hotel called &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plus.google.com&#x2F;112301285038953183757&quot;&gt;Meiji Jingu&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which has a Shintu Temple in the middle. The park was beautiful and it&amp;#39;s great they have things like that in the middle of the city. We paid to go to the museum in the park but it wasn&amp;#39;t that great.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachael and I really enjoyed Tokyo and I would be keen to go back in Spring when all the flowers are out and it isn&amp;#39;t so cold.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2014/narita-airport/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2014&#x2F;narita-airport&#x2F;narita-board.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;narita board&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So our trip to Japan had a terrible start. Well, it started out fine in Australia. In a crazy chance of coincidence we were seated behind a few Ergon guys I know from Townsville. Waiting at Cairns airport they taught me how to play &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Liar&amp;#x27;s_dice&quot;&gt;pirate dice&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which was a fun way to kill time while we waited.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flight itself was okay for Jetstar. I had low expectations and they were basically met. Our problems began as we approached Japan. We were told it was snowing in Tokyo and so there would be a slight delay. At first this sounded like good news, as we were on a skiing holiday after all. After about an hour of flying in circles in heavy turbulence, most people seemed to have their sick bags at the ready. When we finally got cleared for landing it was definitely the craziest landing I&amp;#39;ve experienced. The runway was icy so we did some massive fishtails.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going through security we were pleased to see snow out the window, as it was Mum, Dad, Sarah and Rachael&amp;#39;s first time seeing snowfall. Once through security and at the train station it was a different story. There was a massive line up of people and after much confusion we eventually found out what was going on and that the trains were delayed because of the snow. After waiting in line for a few hours they finally announced that the trains were cancelled and there would be no trains that night. Buses and taxi&amp;#39;s were also not running.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After resigning ourselves to spending the night in the airport (hotels were also booked out), we tried to find food but everywhere was closed. After finding a nice spot of concrete to set down our stuff we tried to sleep. It was as comfortable as you would imagine for a block of concrete with bright fluorescent lighting and constant PA calls about delayed or cancelled flights. At one stage (around 1am) they brought out free sleeping bags which was excellent of them, except the warehouse was nearby to the spot we were camped out so it just created even more noise. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.japantimes.co.jp&#x2F;news&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;09&#x2F;national&#x2F;worst-blizzard-in-45-years-claims-seven-1000-hurt&#x2F;#.Uw3TsvSSwVg&quot;&gt;this news story&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, there was also snacks distributed but we never saw any.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning (I had about 40min sleep I think) the sun was out and so we were optimistic that the trains would be running again, as there wasn&amp;#39;t too much snow on the runway. After waiting in line with everyone else stuck at the airport for the train station to open, we were told that the first train for the day had been cancelled but the next one would maybe run.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After standing in line for a few hours they changed their mind to maybe in the afternoon, then eventually no trains that day with the train station shutting up shop. The really frustrating part was nobody seemed to know anything or want to give any answers throughout. Possibly more information was provided in the Japanese announcements, but those that spoke English weren&amp;#39;t really willing to offer more than &amp;quot;too much snow&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t know&amp;quot;. Perhaps it is a cultural thing where they don&amp;#39;t want to commit to an answer that might be wrong.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2014&#x2F;narita-airport&#x2F;p1110950.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;P1110950&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning at the airport was pretty chaotic. There was huge lines for all the food places. Maccas had a constant wait time of about 1.5 hours, and buy lunch time they had run out of everything except chicken nuggets and french fries. We had breakfast at a restaurant which was expensive, not very nice and had a massive wait.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy lunch time we were all super depressed and tired, and there was still no news of what was happening. We had resigned ourselves to the fact that we would have to spend another night at the airport on the floor. By this stage a lot places were starting to run out of food and there was massive lines for everything. The 7&#x2F;11 store was completely cleaned out, one guy I talked to was contemplating buying a kettle and a packet of pasta.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One place that was open at lunch and had a slightly smaller line was a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Takoyaki&quot;&gt;Takoyaki&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; place. Since the food was fast running out and no supplies could get in, Dad and I thought we better stock up and bought a few boxes of them for lunch&#x2F;dinner. While I didn&amp;#39;t mind the first couple this was not something you can chow down on and eat a lot of. Rachael and Sarah found them disgusting. We never heard the end of it, as Sarah felt sick for the rest of the trip when she saw one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point it felt a bit like being in prison, we couldn&amp;#39;t leave the airport, there was very little food, no comfortable seating (or any free seating really) and there was a massive wait to do anything. So we were all pretty heavily depressed and at the point were I think we would have been happy to turn around and fly home.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end the train line was opened late afternoon, although there was no PA call about it, dad realised when he went for a walk to go to the toilet or something. Despite not being told, there was a huge wait when we got there and an even bigger one behind us before too long, but eventually we got on the train and everyone was happy again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was heaps of snow on the side of the tracks as we entered Tokyo so we finally understood why it had been closed (although you still think they would have been more prepared). In the end we ended up getting to our hotel late that night at about the same time we had originally expected to get there the night before, so all up we were delayed by 24 hours.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were pretty happy just to have a bed and shower, and so just stayed in the hotel leaving the holiday to start until the next day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
