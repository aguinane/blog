        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/croatia/">&lt;p&gt;We landed in Zagreb and picked up our rental car. We wanted to go to see the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Plitvice_Lakes_National_Park&quot;&gt;Plitvice Lakes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; but after looking at transport options decided a rental car was our only option and we wouldn&#x27;t have time to go visit any of the beaches in Croatia. Because multiple drivers costs lots more, we got it in Rachael&#x27;s name and then she she had a bit of a mild panic attack because you drive on the other side of the road and the gears were reversed. Once we got off the highway the roads were terrible and everyone was speeding, and we thought maybe we had made a terrible decision.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually we got there and the lakes were incredible! Well even the car park area was cool and the burgers at the information centre delicious.
Then we walked down to the lakes and there were just waterfalls everywhere. The water was crystal clear and the wooden walkways just above it on cool wooden planks. We didn&#x27;t realise there was actually a recommended circuit until later, but we did a big walk on one side and then got a boat to other side. Then we did another big walk with even bigger waterfalls and a cool cave system. It was unlike anywhere else I&#x27;ve been in the world and absolutely worth the visit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accommodation was okay and easy to find. We had a great (fancy but cheap) dinner up the road that had calamari with mash and Turkey with gnocchi. Having the exchange rate work on your favour again was great.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the next day we had to have another stressful drive back to Zagreb. We did stop at a cool town on the way that had waterfalls under the buildings. And we managed to return the car without incident, and were glad to be rid of it!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;croatia&#x2F;Rastoke.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Rastoke&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Zagreb we got a FlixBus to Slovenia, because it&amp;#39;s outside the Schengen Zone there was a crazy border crossing had trucks backed up for kilometers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;croatia&#x2F;bordercrossing.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Border%20Crossing%20into%20Slovenia&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a bit intimidating as they didn&amp;#39;t really explain what was going on (not in English anyway), but after waiting around for ages and getting our passports stamped we were back on our way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
