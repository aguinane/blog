        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/trip-end/">&lt;p&gt;We dropped the rental car of at Heathrow then got the train back into the city to Lauren&#x27;s.
After 2 months of travel it was good to just chill and watch TV at Lauren&#x27;s.
We went out for a sunday lunch at the pub with Rachael&#x27;s cousin as well, which was good but super expensive.
Stuff in London seems to cost about the same in pounds as it would at home in AUD.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;trip-end&#x2F;newmans.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we made nachos for lunch and lounged around, then at night rented some &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tfl.gov.uk&#x2F;modes&#x2F;cycling&#x2F;santander-cycles&quot;&gt;Borris Bikes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and rode into the city.
Matt recommended it to us as a great way to the see the city, and we started along the river and past Westminster.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;trip-end&#x2F;westminster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then rode up to China Town to get some food.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;trip-end&#x2F;chinatown.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then rode up the Mal and stopped at Buckinham Palace, which was pretty much deserted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;trip-end&#x2F;gate.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was a really good idea, and I highly recommend it. We still had time on our bike rental the next day, so we rode in to the city again on our way to see the Lion King. Really showed how close everything is together, and how inner city Lauren was living.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;trip-end&#x2F;albert.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lion King was great, super creative costumes and even better then Book of Mormon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;trip-end&#x2F;lion-king1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;trip-end&#x2F;lion-king2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our last day Lauren was actually moving, so we helped her move into the new place.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first flight was pretty good, but we had a 9 hour layover in Bangkok, which is a pretty unexciting airport. We found a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;maps&#x2F;MN9TN6E45542&quot;&gt;lounge&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that you could pay to go in for 2 hours and have a shower, so that killed some time but it was a long wait.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;trip-end&#x2F;airport.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we made it home, swapping straight from Spring to Autumn.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/oxford/">&lt;p&gt;On way to Oxford we stopped at Stratford-upon-Avon and saw the church with Shakespeare&#x27;s grave while we stopped for lunch.
There was a nice canal but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;oxford&#x2F;shakespear.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were staying on the outskirts of Oxford so it would be easier to drive in and out, but the area wasn&amp;#39;t all that nice and there weren&amp;#39;t many places to eat.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we got the bus into the center, and went to Blackwell&amp;#39;s Bookshop while we waited for a tour.
It was really cool and had heaps of books. Upstairs was fiction, but they had heaps of non-fiction books downstairs in the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blackwell_UK#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Norrington_room.jpg&quot;&gt;Norrington Room&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that looked interesting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our tour guide was an ex-student and reminded us of Jack Whitehall. There was a graduation on with them all in their gowns, which they also have to wear to exams. We learnt how the colleges were established to separate the students from the townsfolk, as they didn&amp;#39;t get along well and had a habit of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;St_Scholastica_Day_riot&quot;&gt;stabbing each other&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really wanted to go in the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bodleian_Library&quot;&gt;Bodleian Library&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; but it is closed on graduation days. There is a section filmed for the restricted section in harry potter, that is actually restricted as it has lots of old books. It&amp;#39;s also a legal deposit library so they get a copy of every book published in the UK and have over 12 million books. It&amp;#39;s actually so big it&amp;#39;s 5 different buildings, with tunnels and conveyer belts underneath where they can send books between them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;oxford&#x2F;radcliff-camera.jpg&quot; title=&quot;The%20Radcliffe%20Camera&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the Radcliffe Camera our guide pointed out some things that potentially inspired Tolkien and C. S. Lewis who lived there, like this door that has a lion engraving that allegedly inspired the door for the Chronicles of Narnia.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;oxford&#x2F;narnia.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Aslan%20Door&quot; alt=&quot;narnia&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw a pub &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bear_Inn,_Oxford#Tie_collection&quot;&gt;full of cut off neck ties&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and had a pub pointed out where Bob Hawke broke the world record for sculling beer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Einstein&amp;#x27;s_Blackboard&quot;&gt;Einstein&amp;#39;s Blackboard&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in the science museum.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got some Burritos for lunch around the corner from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gropecunt_Lane&quot;&gt;Gropecunt Lane&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We couldn&amp;#39;t get into the main library, but there was a small section in the Weston Library we went to which had original &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Father_Christmas_Letters&quot;&gt;Tolkien Christmas letter&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which was cool to see something actually written by Tolkein but also funny because I&amp;#39;d never head of them before and they reminded me of the notes mum used to write for Sarah as Santa. They had some other rare books on display, like this tiny one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;oxford&#x2F;book.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also went to the Pitt Rivers Museum, and saw some shrunken human heads as well as a really long skull.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;oxford&#x2F;museum.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were going to go to the botanical gardens but they cost money, so instead we just walked along the river and saw all the rowing teams. There was also people on boats they pushed against the ground with poles.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;oxford&#x2F;rowing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/lakes-district/">&lt;p&gt;After driving along the wall, we stopped at our next accommodation which was in Penrith.
We went to the lake in afternoon for dinner. The pubs would be nice in summer, with lots of outdoor beer gardens along the lake.
The lake itself was okay, nothing particularly exciting, although again would be packed in summer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;lakes-district&#x2F;lake.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Ullswater&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we drove back to the Lakes District. On the way we saw a sign to something called Castlerigg Stone Circle, which we went through a extremely tight lane (barely fit one car) to get to.
Was a nice little spot like Stonehenge (and free with no other people).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;lakes-district&#x2F;stones2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Castlerigg%20Stone%20Circle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;lakes-district&#x2F;stones1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Castlerigg%20Stone%20Circle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drove along the Lake trying to find somewhere to stop, but there wasn&amp;#39;t parking anywhere.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;lakes-district&#x2F;bridge.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Ashness%20Bridge&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drove through Honister Pass which had crazy views in the valley, but again was single lane and nowhere to stop.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once through the pass we thought we might as well go see the west coast, and went to St Bees Beach but we couldn&amp;#39;t find anywhere that sold fish and chips and the tide was way out. We stopped for chips at Ulverston, but it wasn&amp;#39;t a very interesting town, and we couldn&amp;#39;t even find anywhere to sit and eat lunch.
We then drove through another scenic pass back inland.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was basically a full day of driving, straight past Manchester and Liverpool on our way to our next stop, which was Bala in Wales.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/alnwick/">&lt;p&gt;On our drive south we wanted to go to the beach. Rachael was navigating so took us to what looked like a sandy beach on the map but was actually Lindisfarne causeway, which was a massive salt pan at low tide. After looking it up we thought about driving across to Lindisfarne Castle but it was really foggy and we didn&#x27;t really know how fast the tides are so thought it was best not to in a rental car.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt really familiar though, and I realised it was &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vikings.wikia.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Raid_of_Lindisfarne&quot;&gt;the island from the second episode&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of the Vikings TV show which I had only just watched before leaving Australia. We drove to a beach a bit further south and tried to see Lindisfarne Castle from there, and could make it out but the weather was still really foggy so not very good views.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to the next beach south though and saw Bamburgh Castle, which was really impressive. The beach itself was actually surprisingly good compared to what I pictured for England. It kind of reminded me of Farnborough, but foggy and cold.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;alnwick&#x2F;beach.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;alnwick&#x2F;beach2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Bamburgh%20Castle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The little village our AirBnB was at was really nice, and there was a field of rapeseed (canola oil) across the road.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;alnwick&#x2F;rapeseed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked up the road to an indian place for dinner, and we were pretty much the only ones there (was a bit early) but was probably one of the best Indian restaurants we&amp;#39;ve been too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed at Alnwick because I saw the poison garden &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atlasobscura.com&#x2F;places&#x2F;alnwick-poison-gardens&quot;&gt;on atlas obscura&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and we thought it would be interesting, but it wasn&amp;#39;t actually that exciting. It was mostly just vegetables and spices, like Rosemary and Lavender which we have in our garden. They did have some interesting one&amp;#39;s like &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aconitum&quot;&gt;monkshood&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Atropa_belladonna&quot;&gt;deadly nightshade&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; but nothing was flowering at the time. They also grow drugs there, but they weren&amp;#39;t out while we were there as they keep them locked up most the year.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;alnwick&#x2F;poison.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Alnwick Garden&amp;#39;s themselves were pretty nice though. The highlight was a section with heaps of different water fountain designs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;alnwick&#x2F;fountain.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Scott did a video on it about a month after we were there:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;jGo9gYypQc8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The castle next door looked pretty cool also, although we didn&amp;#39;t go in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;alnwick&#x2F;alnwick-castle.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Alnwick%20Castle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Alnwick we were heading to the Lakes District on the other side of the country, but we wanted to drive along &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hadrian&amp;#x27;s_Wall&quot;&gt;Hadrian&amp;#39;s Wall&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It was a great drive in general, with lots of rolling green hills with sheep.
The wall was impressive in that something nearly 2000 years old is still there. We went to a museum showing some of the roman history although we could have just done free stuff they implied you had to pay to walk up to the wall (which you don&amp;#39;t for most of it).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latrine was most impressive showing they had plumbing back then.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/leaving-london/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;leaving-london&#x2F;lake.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Pen%20Ponds&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to Richmond Park in the morning, and the girls had breakfast at a cafe which was packed with cyclists.
The park was huge, and it was great weather so we went for a walk. We&amp;#39;d heard there was deer but it&amp;#39;s a huge park and we couldn&amp;#39;t see any. So we went for a drive to look at the lake in the middle and the deer just happened to be there. They were pretty passive compared to the few other deer I have seen in the wild, so must be pretty used to people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;leaving-london&#x2F;deer.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Richmond%20Park%20Deer&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were a little bit rushed for time, as we were flying to Iceland that afternoon so went back to Lauren&amp;#39;s for lunch.
Lauren let us know that she thought daylight savings was coming in that day, so we checked to make sure we weren&amp;#39;t going to be an hour late for our flight, but it actually changed 3am the following morning. Daylight savings is &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=br0NW9ufUUw&quot;&gt;a stupid system&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, I don&amp;#39;t get why people like it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got a bus to Clapham Junction, and got our first normal train to Gatwick airport.
The flight was actually really cool, I had a window seat and we got to see some cool cities from above.
Flying over Scotland and Isle of Skye was also cool, we could see all the rolling hills of the highlands, some of  which still had snow on them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/dover/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dover&#x2F;IMG_0852.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Cliffs&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren has a car so we thought we would take advantage of it and do a day trip somewhere she hadn&amp;#39;t been yet, so headed to see the White Cliffs of Dover and Dover Castle. I was surprised how quickly we got to more rural areas, as I was expecting heaps of urban sprawl like Brisbane, but London is actually pretty contained.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to ignore the National Trust tourist part and headed further up towards the St Margaret&amp;#39;s Bay end where we hoped there would be less people. The cliffs were really awesome, they looked like they were made of chalk and where we went there was no fences just walking tracks and then edge. The walk from the road where we parked was also nice with a bit of forest with wildflowers and some abandoned buildings. It was also cool driving in and seeing the harbor which had lots of massive ships coming and going.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dover&#x2F;IMG_0862.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Cliffs&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dover&#x2F;IMG_0880.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Cliffs&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we went to look at &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.english-heritage.org.uk&#x2F;visit&#x2F;places&#x2F;dover-castle&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Dover Castle&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which was even a cool drive in as we had to drive under a medieval archway. The ticket price was pretty expensive but it was a massive grounds and had heaps of things to see.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we did a tour of underground war hospital. The small amount of the tunnels we saw was pretty extensive and hard to imagine from above. Living down there during the war would have been pretty horrible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dover&#x2F;IMG_0924.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Castle%20Grounds&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dover&#x2F;IMG_20170324_124532.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Underground%20war%20hospital&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a display about some of the various wars between France and how the ownership of the castle had changed, but the highlight by far was the actual castle itself. It was massive and had heaps of little side tunnels and staircases which were almost all open to walk through. They had some displays set up to show how it would have been furnished in the day also. It was interesting how small the beds were because they slept sitting up due to the smoke making it hard to breathe lying down.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dover&#x2F;PANO_20170324_135054.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Dover%20castle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dover&#x2F;IMG_0917.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Castle%20roof&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dover&#x2F;IMG_0902.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Regal&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also cool was the medieval tunnels, which went pretty deep into the ground and were impressive fortifications for the time. We had not expected to stay long but there was so many things to see we were there for hours. The 2,000 year old &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dubris#Lighthouses&quot;&gt;Roman Lighthouse&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was crazy to think it was still standing, and the Roman Church was also pretty cool.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;dover&#x2F;IMG_0938.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Roman%20Church&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went into town to get some lunch, but the town itself wasn&amp;#39;t that great. It was a bit smelly and nothing particularly interesting to see.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/more-london/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;more-london&#x2F;towerbridge.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Tower%20Bridge&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some sleep, we headed back out to explore some more of London.
The beautiful weather from the previous day had ended and we got some of the London weather we were expecting in the form of cold miserable light rain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up we went to see Tower of London and Tower Bridge. We were planning to go inside but the tickets were about $50 AUD each, so we thought we&amp;#39;d find something a bit cheaper to do.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to go check out Greenwich, so we tried to get a boat up the River Thames, but we didn&amp;#39;t have enough credit on our oyster cards and you couldn&amp;#39;t top them up at the ferry terminal. So we got a train there instead. We quickly stopped by the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cutty_Sark&quot;&gt;Cutty Sark&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; ship on the way also.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a beautiful area (despite the weather) and we really enjoyed the tour of the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Royal_Observatory,_Greenwich&quot;&gt;Royal Observatory&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. They had lots of old clock designs and talked about the history of improving navigation on the seas and ways to calculate latitude and longitude.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;more-london&#x2F;greenwich.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Greenwich&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;more-london&#x2F;prime-meridian.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Prime%20Meridian&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Greenwich we headed to Leicester Square and had a very rushed lunch at Chinatown before Rachael and I went to go see the Book of Mormon (which was awesome).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;more-london&#x2F;mormon.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Book%20of%20Mormon&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the show we had a look around some of the shops while we waited for Lauren to come meet us again, particularly cool was the Lego Store.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;more-london&#x2F;lego.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Lego%20Store&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We noticed that there were a heap of choppers flying around so looked on the news that there had been &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2017_Westminster_attack&quot;&gt;an attack&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; at Westminster (lucky for us that we had gone the day before).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;more-london&#x2F;choppers.jpg&quot; title=&quot;lots%20of%20choppers&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dinner we were meeting Rachael&amp;#39;s cousin and his partner at &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thealchemist.uk.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;The Alchemist&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cgpgrey.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-secret-city-of-london.html&quot;&gt;City of London&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which took a while to get to as the traffic was pretty crazy. It wasn&amp;#39;t so bad for Rachael and I though as it gave us more time to sightsee on the bus. After dinner, we went up to the Sky Bar which had a free lift to the top and had great views of the city and a band.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;more-london&#x2F;alchemist.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Drink%20at%20The%20Alchemist&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;more-london&#x2F;skybar.jpg&quot; title=&quot;View%20from%20Sky%20Bar&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we went in for lunch at the Borough Markets, which was like any international food market, except with a few different ones to what we are used to in Australia (such as Ethopian).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here we made our way along the river towards Shakespeare&amp;#39;s Globe, which wasn&amp;#39;t super exciting from the outside. Along the way I thought the ruins of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.english-heritage.org.uk&#x2F;visit&#x2F;places&#x2F;winchester-palace&quot;&gt;Winchester Palace&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; were pretty cool.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;more-london&#x2F;winchester-palace.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Winchester%20Palace&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came across the TATE modern art museum, which was full of weird modern art. GOMA in Brisbane is
way better in my opinion. There was a nice view from the top of the building though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;more-london&#x2F;tate-modern-roof.jpg&quot; title=&quot;TATE%20Modern%20Roof&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That afternoon we just chilled at Lauren&amp;#39;s and then went to one of her local pubs the Crab Tree. There was an open mic night with a few good bands, although I didn&amp;#39;t think food was very good. They also had posters for &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Boat_Race&quot;&gt;a boat race&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; the next weekend between Oxford and Cambridge which apparently is a big deal.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first stop in our Europe trip was to London to visit Rachael&amp;#39;s sister Lauren.
So after a Uber to the bus station, a bus to Brisbane, a long flight to Bangkok, a long boring layover and then an even longer flight to London, we arrived at Heathrow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren met us at arrivals and then we got our first tube ride to Hammersmith and then a bus to her place. Her place was pretty cool and very stereotypical of what you would expect in London, with a very steep staircase and a cupboard under the stairs. It was a lovely day and all the trees in her street were in flower also.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we had unpacked and had a chance to catch up, Rachael and I got the tube to Kensington to find a Three Store and get a cheap SIM so we would have data on our trip (the plan had free roaming in the other countries we were going to). From there we were headed to the museums but walked through Hyde Park on the way (looking at a map now it was technically Kensington Gardens).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were not expecting to seen anything like the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Albert_Memorial&quot;&gt;Albert Memorial&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which was enormous and the gold was extremely bright in the sun. And it was opposite the awesome-looking Royal Albert Hall, which I had heard of but didn&amp;#39;t realise it was opposite a park or a giant gold statue.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;first-day-in-london&#x2F;hyde3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hyde park&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here we walked past lots of embassy buildings to go see the Natural History Museum. This is actually a building that we knew looked awesome, except the front entrance was blocked off and under renovations and so we couldn&amp;#39;t actually see it. Inside was pretty cool, although we had higher expectations and it wasn&amp;#39;t that different to other museums really, just a lot larger.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;first-day-in-london&#x2F;lion.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;lion&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we wanted to go to the science museum, but between the two we quickly popped into the Victoria museum which had Raphael posters which were &amp;#39;on loan from Her Majesty the Queen&amp;#39;. You would think it would just be donated to the museum, but good you could seem the for free. Rachael liked all the old clothes which were the majority of the displays.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite place was the Science museum. It had heaps of cool displays especially the space exhibits and large projected globe with various satellite imagery.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the museums we met back up with Lauren at Hyde Park. From there it was a short walk to Buckingham palace and Trafalgar square. It was really crazy how close all the main sights are to each other, and how close Lauren was staying to the city also.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;first-day-in-london&#x2F;queen.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;queen&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had lunch and then walked to Westminster to see Big Ben and parliament.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we got home I was wrecked from not sleeping in about 2 days, so Rachael and Lauren want to get some fish and chips for dinner but I fell asleep.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
