          <description xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/vargberg/">&lt;p&gt;Next up we got a train to Guttenberg to meet my friend Johan. I was surprised by the amount of forest on the train ride, unfortunately our train seat didn&#x27;t have a window but from what we could see there wasn&#x27;t many towns on the way. We met Johan at Guttenberg then went to meatball house, and got some Swedish meatballs which were delicious.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here Johan drove us to his new apartment in Varberg. It was a really nice place, and the area really reminded me of Turgi. We went to the grocery store and bottle-o, interestingly Johan said that alcohol over 3.5% can only be sold at a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Systembolaget&quot;&gt;government run store&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, where we bought some really nice Swedish wheat beer.
It was Johan&#x27;s birthday, so went out to a nice Indian place for dinner.  Johan&#x27;s place even had ocean views.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;vargberg&#x2F;sunset.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Varberg%20Sunset&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning was really foggy, so we thought it would be a good time to go back into Guttenberg and visit Universium. It was a science museum but also had a cool rainforest and aquarium. It also had a cool space section where they had scales that had your weight on different planets.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;vargberg&#x2F;Universium1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Universium&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;vargberg&#x2F;Universium2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Universium&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back we stopped at an English-Style castle called Tjol√∂holms slott.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;vargberg&#x2F;castle.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Tjol%C3%B6holms%20slott&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;vargberg&#x2F;castle2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Tjol%C3%B6holms%20slott&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we went to see the Varberg Fortress, there was also a really interesting looking swimming pool structure at the beach. They had photos of people swimming in the middle of winter when the ocean is frozen, but the water looked nice the day we were there (it was still way too cold though).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;vargberg&#x2F;fortress.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Varbergs%20F%C3%A4stning&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;vargberg&#x2F;bath.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Kallbadhuset&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to meet Johan&amp;#39;s parents and had a lovely home cooked meal. They also lived near a really nice beach, I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting Sweden to have nice beaches.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;vargberg&#x2F;beach.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we went for a drive inland and went for a walk along some of the lakes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;vargberg&#x2F;lake.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johan was an excellent host, and we had an amazing time in Sweden. It wasn&amp;#39;t what I was expecting at all and was also great having a local experience. We learnt lots and found out heaps of interesting things you wouldn&amp;#39;t normally, like the fact that Denmark is so close that the TV could pick up both Swedish and Danish channels, and that they have a self serve checkout system over there where you get a handheld scanner to take with you and scan the items as you shop.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Stockholm</title>

          <description xml:base="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2017/stockholm/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;stockholm&#x2F;stockholm.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Stockholm&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We flew into Stockholm and it was snowing outside when we arrived, not something we were expecting for Spring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got a train from the airport into the city and checked into our AirBnB. We then went for a walk around the old town which was full of pretty buildings. We visited
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;medeltidsmuseet.stockholm.se&#x2F;in-english&#x2F;&quot;&gt;a free medieval museum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which was on a little island next to the Royal Palace. Was a really cool area and the museum was pretty interesting. The old town itself was nice to just walk around.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;stockholm&#x2F;medieval.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Medieval%20Museum&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left early the next morning to walk to Skansen, after picking up some awesome pastry for breakfast from Coop.
Skansen is an open air museum and zoo, but since it was still cold most things were closed and the animals were hibernating or not around. We did see some reindeer and wolves, and there was great views from the hill, but overall we weren&amp;#39;t super impressed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;stockholm&#x2F;skansen1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Skansen&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;stockholm&#x2F;skansen2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Skansen&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;stockholm&#x2F;skansen3.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Wolves&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to Skansen there was a really cool looking biological museum. We thought it was part of the Skansen ticket, but it wasn&amp;#39;t and was pretty expensive admission. The guy on the door gave us a discount though, and it had a really cool double helix staircase.  The exhibit was mostly unchanged in 100 years, and while it wasn&amp;#39;t that impressive after being to the natural history museum in London, at the time it was built it must have seemed incredible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;stockholm&#x2F;museum2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Double%20Helix%20Staircase&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;stockholm&#x2F;museum3.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Biological%20Museum&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we went to the Vasa Museum, which was definitely the highlight of Stockholm for us. The &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vasamuseet.se&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Vasa&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was a massive warship that sank on it&amp;#39;s maiden voyage. They recently pulled it out of the water and restored it, and built a giant museum around it. The museum has so much more to offer then I was expecting, for example they have a floor where they have the skeletons of the crew that died when it sank, along with their belongings and clothes, which allowed them to learn a huge amount of detail about how people lived during that time period.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;stockholm&#x2F;vasa1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Vasa&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.guinman.id.au&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2017&#x2F;stockholm&#x2F;vasa2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Vasa&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Vasa Museum, we were starving and walked into the city to get a late lunch. We were going to look around, but it started raining, so we got the train back to the accommodation. Once it started to cool it turned to snow again later in the evening.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
