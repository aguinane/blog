<p>Last weekend was the start of the Toowoomba Carnival of Flowers. We bought 3-day tickets to the Flower, Food and Wine Festival so we could check out all the bands.</p>

<p>Friday night was our first glimpse of the festival. It was sort of like a show with various art and flower displays, but nothing overly exciting. Other than that there was stalls selling garden stuff, and food stalls. One thing that was a very good set up was the wine stalls though. You could go around and taste the wine at each stall, and then buy a bottle if you wanted to drink while you watched the bands.</p>

<p>The first night the bands were Owl Eyes and Bluejuice. Owl Eyes sounded great, but I didn&#39;t particularly get into any of their originals. Bluejuice were really good, but not as lively as when I saw them in Rocky.</p>
<p>Second night Ross Wilson (Daddy Cool) played, which was pretty cool to see the Eagle Rock live. I think Rachael was disappointed that everyone didn&#39;t drop their pants. Mental as Anything also played, but we left before they finished their set.</p>

<p>On Sunday Lior played. Was a pretty great set, and he finished with 2 new songs that he had never played live before. I thought one new song (Alas) was particularly good, so I am excited for his new album. In the afternoon James Reyne (Australian Crawl) played, and was pretty good. The final act was an ABBA tribute, Bjorn Again. They didn&#39;t sound that great for the opening song but ended up sounding really good.</p>
