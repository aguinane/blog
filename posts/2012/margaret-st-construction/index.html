<p>So I was in Brisbane a couple of weeks ago for work, and stayed at the Oaks on Margaret. I stayed there in November last year as well, and the building next door, <a href="https://maps.google.com.au/maps?q=234+Margaret+St,+Brisbane&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=-27.471862,153.029106&amp;spn=0.002589,0.005005&amp;sll=-27.471772,153.028736&amp;sspn=0.010357,0.02002&amp;t=h&amp;gl=au&amp;hnear=234+Margaret+St,+Queensland+4000&amp;z=18">234 Margaret St</a> was being constructed, but was full of water as a result of the flood at the start of the year. Was pretty cool to see, there was even boats that I am assuming the construction guys use.</p>

<p>So when staying there the other day I took some photos of the basement without water. It&#39;s still impressive just how deep a hole they need to dig to build a skyscraper.</p>
