<p>Once again finding ten songs to vote for has been a challenge. Normally it is because I have too many songs to choose from. This year I have been a bit slack with listening to new music, so the challenge was filling the ten slots with songs I felt deserved it, whilst not voting for the same artist more than once.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure when I see the final list there will be plenty of songs that may have deserved my vote that I didn&#39;t consider, but in any case I am happy with the following ten for now, so here they are.</p>
<p><strong>Gotye - <a href="http://vimeo.com/26028186">Somebody That I Used To Know</a></strong>
This is clearly going to take out the number 1 spot. I remember when Sarah used to tell me to turn that &quot;weird shit&quot; off when I used to play Like Drawing Blood. Good on him for making a pop hit.</p>
<p><strong>The Beards - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJkLH4uZ73M">You Should Consider Having Sex With a Bearded Man</a></strong>
I am a sucker for musically awesome novelty bands.</p>
<p><strong>Busby Marou â€“ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-KYLJlhb0">Underlying Message</a></strong>
They were probably even more impressive then Birds of Tokyo when I saw them at the Western. Good to see a local band making it relatively big.</p>
<p><strong>Tim Minchin - <a href="http://vimeo.com/11338327">Pope Song</a></strong>
I remember having an argument with someone at work (when I worked at K-mart) about swearing and how it is wrong because it says so in the bible. This song perfectly sums up my thoughts on the matter. I wasn&#39;t expecting this to chart, but considering none of Tim Minchin&#39;s new songs were listed in the song list I guess not even some of the less controversial one&#39;s will feature either, which is a shame.</p>
<p><strong>Bluejuice - <a href="http://vimeo.com/30294624">Act Your Age</a></strong>
I have always liked their recordings, but I was a bit dissapointed in Bluejuice when I saw the at Big Day Out a few years ago. At the Oxy Street party last week they changed my mind though, and this song went off live.</p>
<p><strong>Nero - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE47er6qnqg">Me &amp; You</a></strong>
I don&#39;t know why I like this song, but I do.</p>
<p><strong>Boy &amp; Bear - <a href="http://vimeo.com/28277640">Feeding Line</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Black Keys - <a href="http://vimeo.com/32543029">Lonely Boy</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Ball Park Music -<a href="http://vimeo.com/32608568"> It&#39;s Nice To Be Alive</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Intermashional First Class - <a href="http://vimeo.com/13974136">All I Know</a> {Ft. Eagle And The Worm/Hypnotic Brass Ensemble/Juiceboxxx}</strong>
My actual vote is for Eagle and the Worm - All I Know, but this was technically released in 2010.</p>
