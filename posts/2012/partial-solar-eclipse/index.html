I&#39;ve always thought it would be cool to see a solar eclipse. I knew about the one in Cairns for a few years now and had intended to head up, but what with not knowing where I would be working couldn&#39;t book travel. And since we are going to Fiji early next year, and there is no airport in Toowoomba, it wasn&#39;t worth trying to get time off work to drive up, and Rachael definitely couldn&#39;t.</p>
<p>In any case it was still semi exciting to see the partial one from down here in Toowoomba. Attempts to photograph it with my camera failed, but I eventually worked out you could see the eclipse in the halo of the photos from my phone camera.</p>
<p>Since it was only partial, it didn&#39;t get very dark here. It did dim slightly and the sky had a weird tinge to it like it looked like a few weeks ago when there were bush fires and lots of smoke in the air. There was no temperature drops or birds going quite.</p>

<p>I also tried out using the binoculars in reverse, which was a pretty good way to check how much was covered but you still couldn&#39;t see much.</p>
<p>Was a cool experience, a bit bummed I didn&#39;t get to experience the totality though. Maybe we can visit Indonesia in 2016.</p>
