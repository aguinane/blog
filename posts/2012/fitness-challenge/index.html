<p>Rachael and I are doing a fitness challenge on account of us being lazy in Brisbane and not playing any sport. We are also trying to eat better and lose weight, but my main goal is to start going for runs and ride to work again. I have gone for a few runs last week with Strava on, and it records your personal best times:</p>
<p><a href="http://app.strava.com/athletes/681775">My Strava Statistics</a>
Best 1k 	00:04:28
Best 1 mile 	00:08:52</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure what a realistic goal to set is at this stage, but I am aiming for at maybe a 6min mile in the next month or so.</p>
