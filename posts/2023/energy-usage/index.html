  Energy Usage

<p>I did <a href="/posts/2019/energy-data/">a post a few years back</a> looking at our energy usage at our old house. We've been in the new place for 2 years now and with solar and electric hot water and cooking the charts are more interesting now.</p>
<p>If you know a little bit of python I've <a href="https://github.com/aguinane/energy-report#energy-report">published the script used to make these charts</a> if you want to run with your own data.</p>

<p>We got the hot water system put on a timer when we moved in and I originally set it to run from 08:00 - 15:00 with a top up at midnight, but after getting the first bill back quickly realised most of the hot water heating was happening at night time and not using the solar. So I got rid of the night-time timer and we have never ended up with cold water. I later changed it again to come on later (from 09:30) to make even better use of the free solar.</p>

<p>The other significant loads are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aircon heating on winter mornings</li>
<li>Typical evening cooking etc. (can&#39;t do much about that)</li>
<li>A tiny bit off aircon cooling in the summer evening (but less then heating - so cancels out for time-of-use tariffs)</li>
</ul>
<p>A new time of use tariff came out today (12C) that is designed for people with battery systems, but looks pretty good for us in Toowoomba even without a battery given most of our load is outside of that evening period.
According to the <a href="https://www.energymadeeasy.gov.au">Energy Made Easy</a> website it&#39;s the best option too.</p>
