<p>Like always I limited it to one song per artist.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ball Park Music - It&#39;s Nice To Be Alive (2011)</li>
</ol>
<p>I came close to going for Coming Down (2012) but went for the one more likely to get in the Top 10.
They had a bunch of songs from across the whole decade so hopefully they place highly.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Bluejuice - Act Yr Age (2011)</li>
</ol>
<p>Bluejuice likewise had a bunch of hits I could have voted for, but chose this as the top pick.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Matt Corby - Brother (2011)</li>
</ol>
<p>Still hasn&#39;t gotten old even after hearings lots of drunken renditions.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Haim - Falling (2013)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Wire is probably more likely to get in the list, but I like this one more.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Lorde - Royals (2013)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Preatures - Is This How You Feel (2014)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Was tossing up between this and a bunch of Saskwatch songs.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Tame Impala - The Less I Know The Better (2015)</li>
</ol>
<p>In the yearly poll I struggled to decide between this and Let It Happen and was the same this time.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Methyl Ethel - Ubu (2017)</li>
</ol>
<p>Once I hear this song it gets stuck in my head for ages.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<p>Alex Lahey - I Haven&#39;t Been Taking Care Of Myself (2017)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ruby Fields - Dinosaurs (2018)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I didn&#39;t vote for this in the yearly poll but it has grown on me since.</p>
<p>Some other songs that were on the short-list but not mentioned above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adele - Someone Like You (2011)</li>
<li>Busby Marou - Five Rocks (2010) or Underlying Message (2010)</li>
<li>Childish Gambino - 3005 (2013) or Redbone (2016)</li>
<li>Florence + The Machine - Delilah (2015)</li>
<li>Gang of Youths - Let Me Down Easy (2017) or Magnolia (2015)</li>
<li>Jarryd James - Do You Remember (2015)</li>
<li>Kanye West - Runaway (2010)</li>
<li>King Gizzard &amp; The Lizard Wizard - Rattlesnake (2017)</li>
<li>Little Red - Rock It (2010)</li>
<li>Marus Marr &amp; Chet Faker - The Trouble With Us (2015)</li>
<li>Vance Joy - Riptide (2013)</li>
</ul>
