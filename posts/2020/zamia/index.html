<p>The <a href="https://parks.des.qld.gov.au/parks/mount-archer/about">National Parks Website</a> doesn&#39;t have any info about this walk for some reason. There were signs at the top and bottom with information though.</p>
<p>The ascent trail starts at First Turkey just past the waterhole and toilet block for the mountain bike tracks, with a sign that says to allow for 4 hours each way. We were staying with Rachael&#39;s parents whilst in Rocky so I just walked from there with the plan to meet Rachael at the top for lunch.</p>

<p>The waterhole and creek were bone dry (as it often is). You can ride your bike on the first part as the national park doesn&#39;t start until further up.</p>

<p>You walk along a service road for a while next to the creek.</p>

<p>Eventually, the trail leaves the service road and there are a few creek crossing and staircases (both up and down).</p>

<p>There was actually bits of (stagnant) water in places as you got further upstream. The walk would definitely be much nicer after some rain.</p>

<p>The ascent up the mountain proper was a bit overgrown and not as enjoyable as walking along the creek. There was some nice views if you stopped and turned around.</p>

<p>Mt Sleipner Lookout wasn&#39;t as exciting as I was expecting. Definitely good news but not that much better then you can get from the top of the hike.</p>

<p>The lookout at the top has had a bit more work since <a href="/posts/2018/rocky-again/">last time</a> we went. And it was surprisingly busy for a weekday, everyone must still be enjoying the lifting of lockdown.</p>

<p>The highlights were definitely the dry rainforest part of the upper creek, and the views from the top of Mt Archer. I enjoyed it but would skip the ascent next time. The majority of the trail isn&#39;t too steep. It&#39;s just the last bit with a steep climb.</p>
