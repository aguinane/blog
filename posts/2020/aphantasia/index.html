<p>Last year I came across this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c4i94n/tifu_by_explaining_my_synesthesia_to_my_boyfriend/">reddit post</a> (just before going to bed) which completely blew my mind (like the boyfriend in the post). So many sayings and things from movies (flashback scenes) finally made sense, but I still thought I must be understanding something and that the minds-eye visualisation described was exaggerated. I was eventually able to get to sleep but first thing in the morning I made Rachael watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewsGmhAjjjI">this video</a>.</p>
<p>So turns out that Rachael can visalise things, but I can&#39;t. Which made perfect sense and explained so many things at the same time as completely blowing both our minds.</p>
<p>I ended up reading a bunch of stuff online, like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/blake-ross/aphantasia-how-it-feels-to-be-blind-in-your-mind/10156834777480504">this post</a> in which he can&#39;t even &quot;hear&quot; sounds in his head. This was actually pretty helpful as I can &#39;hear&#39; sound in my head but cannot do the same thing with vision. It helped solidify that we were talking about the same thing when we meant you can &#39;see&#39; things with your mind in the same way - and that I definitely can&#39;t.</p>
<p>Interestingly he mentioned in that section that he does have an inner monologue but that the audio has no texture. But then last month <a href="https://insidemymind.me/2020/01/28/today-i-learned-that-not-everyone-has-an-internal-monologue-and-it-has-ruined-my-day/">this article</a> did the rounds about some people not having inner monologues either. It seems like nothing about how our brain works can be taken for granted.</p>
<p>The next thing Rachael and I did was start asking everyone about whether they had Aphantasia or not. Dad has it, but no-one else in the family. Only one of the nurses at Rachael&#39;s work had it. A bunch of my engineering friends did have it. I wonder if there is a correlation with some professions, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47830256">this article</a> suggests 1 in 50 people have it. There is also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arc1fdoMi2Y">TED Talk</a> about Aphantasia, which suggests that the concept is pretty new.</p>
<p>Shortly after this Lyra was born, and in the sleep deprivation of the first few weeks I realised that I could visualise things as I was drifting into sleep (and then woken up again). I couldn&#39;t really control what I was seeing though so Rachael quickly shot this down as just dreaming and not the same thing. I still can&#39;t do it while awake though and day-dreaming is such a crazy word to me now.</p>
