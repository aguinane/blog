<p>While we were mostly interested in the health aspect, the main selling point on ads for DNA tests is seeing your ancestry.
I was expecting the results for that part to be pretty underwhelming, and they were - confirming I am indeed descended from European immigrants.</p>

<p>The matching is really interesting though, it finds sections of your DNA that match that of others, and sums the shared segments which are measured in centimorgans.</p>

<p>I knew the relationship to a match on Mum&#39;s side (blue) and one on dad&#39;s (blue), so you can see the parts of the DNA that come from which side when comparing to those peoples results.</p>

<p>The one on mum&#39;s side was an X-Match, which makes sense because you get the X from your mum&#39;s side.
You can do Y and mt tests to see direct lines, but that&#39;s not part of the cheaper autosomal tests we got, which only tests small segments not your full genome.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t actually know how you are related (like 99% of my matches) you can make a rough guess about how closely related you are <a href="https://thegeneticgenealogist.com/2017/08/26/august-2017-update-to-the-shared-cm-project/">based on the cM&#39;s</a>, which is how paternity tests work.</p>

<p>Considering the first DNA tests were only done in the 80s, I thought it was pretty cool to be able to see how DNA is passed on with your own results, and the detail you can match people to with a bit of spit.</p>
