<p>I left my Kindle on the train when we arrived in Salzburg which was a bummer, and the first thing we lost for the trip.</p>
<p>The old town was pretty, but outside of the old town wasn&#39;t very exciting. One thing we noticed was just how fast the water in the river was flowing, and the hugh amounts of water pouring in from the various little storm water outlets.</p>
<p>There were lots of references to Mozart, for example his house/museum/your local SPAR supermarket.</p>

<p>It was actually interesting how standard the shops were but they were done up to look authentic, like on Getreidegasse the McDonalds had a really old style golden arch sign that was in the same style as the rest of the shops in the street. There was also lots of little cool side alleys everywhere, and it is a stark contrast being in a city that was designed for pedestrians well before the invention of cars.</p>
<p>We went to the Festung Hohensalzburg (Fortress) for a concert but the ticket included looking around before hand. It had really nice views of the city.</p>

<p>We then saw a Mozart concert which was really good, but I didn&#39;t recognise as many of the songs as I was expecting to. You could tell they were very talented musicians as it looked very technically difficult.</p>

<p>The next day went for walk through Mirabell Palace Gardens, which were really nice. The actual palace was closed though.</p>

<p>Most of the churches were closed for Easter services, but we did go in one really cool one.</p>

<p>There was another one with a graveyard out the back, which also had buildings carved into the cliff-side.

<p>We walked up on ridge and found a nice grassy that looked out over the Alps was nice. You could faintly make out a gondola going up and down the mountain.</p>

<p>Unfortunately most things were shut while we were there but we still enjoyed out time. We had really nice Indian for dinner.</p>
<p>The next day we had a lazy morning as it was raining, and then got a ticket on the next train to Munich (which was a massive wait of 4 minutes).</p>
