<p>For our last day in Iceland we went to the Blue Lagoon Geothermal Spa. It stinks of sulphur as you come in but you get used to it after a bit. I wasn't expecting to like it that much as it's more Rachael's thing, but was pretty fun.
They had a steam bath which was intense as you walk in as it's dark and the steam is so thick you can hardly breathe. It was pretty overwhelming so we didn't like it, but I tried it again later and it was more enjoyable. It was nice standing out in the freezing cold breeze and then going in. The main reason I liked it though was that it was in the middle of the lava fields so was a nice view from the pool.</p>

<p>The spa is actually next to a geothermal power station, which was cool to see with steam just pouring out of it.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, we just walked around the city. There was some nice parks and a lake.</p>

<p>We went to a place for dinner that had hot soups in a cob loaf, and it was delicious.</p>

<p>And that night, there was a jazz band at the hostel who were pretty good. Although, we didn&#39;t stay too long as we had to get up really early for our flight the next morning.</p>
