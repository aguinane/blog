<p>We booked a farmhouse on AirBnB which was really hard to find and Rachael was a bit freaked out when we got there because it was in the middle of nowhere and there wasn't anybody home. But the owners showed up a bit later and were really nice, and put on an amazing breakfast.</p>
<p>The next morning we went for a hike. To hike Mt Snowden you need to get there extremely early to get a car park, so we did the less popular <a href="http://www.eryri-npa.gov.uk/visiting/walking/mountain-walks/crimpiau-capel-curig">Crimpiau</a> one instead. There was a free car park at the start next to a waterfall.</p>
<p>It's through farm land so there were heaps of sheep and lamb at the start. Also lots of stiles and ladders to cross fences.</p>

<p>The start was a nice woodland area, and then it got more open.</p>

<p>About half way up there was a really nice view of a lake on the other side.</p>

<p>Was super windy at the top, but not as bad as Scotland. We could hear jets flying over which echoed across the whole valley, although we couldn&#39;t see them.</p>

<p>Rachael was saying how great it was to be able to go on a hike without worrying about snakes and spiders, and about 5 minutes later she freaked out when I nearly stood on a small bright orange snake. I didn&#39;t see it until it was slithering away, but it was really pretty.</p>
<p>The path then went through a bog. I never really knew what a bog was and thought it was like a wetland.
The ground looked like solid dry grass, but when you step on it you sink slightly and your shoe fills with water. Not very pleasant but was a bit trippy at first so cool in that sense.</p>

<p>After out hike, we drove past the base of the Snowden walk, and even the drive up was crazy high. Rachael didn&#39;t like driving near a shear drop, and it was a bit like driving to the ski fields in New Zealand. The car park was packed so we are glad we did the other hike. There was a cool quarry at the bottom on the other side as well.</p>
<p>Since the distances are so small, we drove a bit further to the beach and actually found a proper fish and chips shop this time.
It was actually a nice little beach besides the rocks.</p>

<p>There was also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinas_Dinlle">hillfort</a> which had a nice view.</p>

<p>We drove bank to Bala lake as we didn&#39;t get a chance to see it the day before.</p>

<p>On our last night, the pig at the farm gave birth to piglets. And Rachael couldn&#39;t leave without patting their lamb.</p>
