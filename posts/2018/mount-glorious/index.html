<p>We decided to drive home a different way from Brisbane and come back through Mt Glorious (D'Aguilar National Park).
It was a much more scenic drive then going through the city and not much longer from Joyner.</p>
<p>First we did the Maiala walk to Greeneâ€™s Falls.</p>

<p>The track to the waterfall was super muddy, but the last bit had a walkway and we even saw a wallaby.</p>

<p>We then drove a bit further to campsite that had a lookout towards Wivenhoe.</p>

<p>Then we went on to Wivenhoe Dam itself. The view from the lower lookout was pretty
cool, and how they had carved the rock was super impressive.</p>

<p>There wasn&#39;t much to see from up the top but it would be a good place to go camping and get a kayak.</p>
