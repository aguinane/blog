<p>From Katoomba we headed off to the Central Coast. To split up the drive a bit our first stop was Hornsby, where we went to the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/NnhNZ5VvSzCEk5a59">Lisgar Gardens</a> and a <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Gngjgv8ACfK8kYkWA">Playground</a>.</p>

<p>We stopped for lunch in Gosford, and went to the Gosford Regional Gallery which also had a Japanese Gardens.</p>

<p>As it was a Friday night we struggled to book last-minute accommodation, but ended up getting one night at an apartment right on The Entrance.</p>

<p>The water was pretty chilly but the kids were still keen to hop in at the ocean baths.</p>

<p>We went for a walk and found out there was a <a href="https://chromefest.org/">Chromefest</a> event on with live music which was pretty cool to stumble on.</p>

<p>I did The Entrance Parkrun in the morning which was around the lagoon side and definitely not as scenic as the ocean side of town.</p>

<p>After checking-out we started heading north up the coast, with the first stop being Norah Head Lighthouse.</p>

<p>We stopped at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Vrd8ESJDcZU321dF7">Caves Beach</a>, it was getting close to lunch time so it took a bit of coaxing but eventually got the kids down there and they had a great time exploring the cave. I wasn&#39;t expecting that you could cross under without going around the rocks, or that it would be full of washed up blue bottles and was definitely a very cool beach.</p>

<p>We had some Fish &amp; Chips at Blacksmiths Beach and then on to Newcastle.</p>
