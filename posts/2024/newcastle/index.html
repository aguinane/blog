<p>We had a bit of a drive around Newcastle while the kids were asleep but spent most of the afternoon at the hotel as it had a pool.</p>
<p>The next morning we met up with Rachael's cousins at Merewether Beach, and I was suprised by how good the surf was and how nice the beaches were considering they are next to a large port.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we went to the Blackbutt Nature Reserve which had a little free zoo. It had peacocks around like Rocky Zoo used to.</p>

<p>The kids both loved this <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/93oZ4PaxCLva5Yqp6">Fairy Garden</a> we found just along the creek that someone had made out the front of their house.</p>
