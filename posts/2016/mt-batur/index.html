<p>From Ubud, we got up at 2 in the morning so we could do the sunrise hike of Mt Batur, which is an active volcano. After about an hour drive we got to the start of the trek and met our guides, who gave us torches and led the way.</p>
<p>After lots of stops we made it to the top, but still couldn&#39;t see much as it was still dark. Then it started to piss down rain and so we got soaked, but our guides brought ponchos for us so at least our clothes kept mostly dry. Due to the cloud we missed the sunrise, but eventually it started to clear and we could see through the clouds at the spectacular view below.</p>
<p>We then went over the lip to where the steam vents were and were instantly warmed up. Our guides cooked eggs and banana sandwiches for us in the steam from the volcano which was pretty neat.</p>
<p>The rest of the morning was great weather and we could admire the views for the walk down. There was no hot lava, but you could see black lava flows from when the volcano last erupted in 1999. Walking down the lava &#39;sand&#39; was pretty bizarre as it was super loose fine rock that you could slide down on a bit like you were skiing.</p>

<p>It was a great hike and one of the highlights of our trip.</p>
<p>We picked up our bags from the hotel in Ubud on the way back, and then traveled onward to Keramas for the wedding.</p>
