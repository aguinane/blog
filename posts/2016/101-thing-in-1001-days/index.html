  101 Things in 1001 Days

<p class="subtitle"><strong>2016-01-30</strong></p>



<p>While I was living in Switzerland I attempted to put together a list of <a href="https://dayzeroproject.com/about/">101 Things in 1001 Days</a>. The goal was to publish it on the Tales from Turgi blog and cross them off in blog posts, but I never finalised my list of 101 things. Since I was travelling lots I kept on thinking of new better ideas, and was crossing off old ones. I actually tried to make one earlier then that for the 1001 day period of 07 Jul 2009 to 24 Dec 2011, but couldn't think of 101 things I thought were worthy. When I was Europe it was the opposite and I had way more then 101 and couldn't cut it down.</p>
<p>Some of the items on the list were for things I wanted to do when I got back to Australia, so when I got back I had another go at updating the list. This time I decided I would just make it a bucket list style one's and I actually added some things I had done since before going to Switzerland. So I added in a couple of goals I had leaving school and going into uni that I had already crossed off as well. I'd never flown in a plane when I started uni which was a pretty big thing at the time, although since then I've probably been on hundreds of flights. But despite updating the list a few times, I never did set a time deadline.</p>
<p>A friend posted on Facebook for New Years this year a list of 100 things they wanted to achieve by the end of this year and it reminded me of my list. So I figured it was a good time to actually post my list and maybe set a deadline.</p>
<p>So firstly, I went through my old list and here is a list of all the things I've already crossed off (since 2007 when I started university) from the original list.</p>
