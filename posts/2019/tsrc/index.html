  Toowoomba Second Range Crossing Marathon
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2019-09-08</strong></p>



<p>The TSRC opened on the Sunday with a marathon (there was a also a bike race and open day on the Saturday that Mark and Julie went to). I only signed up for the 10km as I (correctly) assumed I would still be sleep deprived on the day.</p>

<p>The bypass was pretty impressive, although it was hard to see much from the eastbound lane.</p>

<p>The downhill was okay (after a quick pee stop), but at the turnaround point the uphill was disgusting. It was super windy and a massive headwind with an uphill climb was unpleasant and I had to keep stopping to walk.</p>

<p>Despite the challenging second half I finished <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2688817635">just under an hour</a> which I was prety happy with. The <a href="http://www.racetecresults.com/myresults.aspx?uid=16228-100-3-11559">official race times</a> had issues apparently, so it has it a few minutes slower.</p>
<p>Was a pretty cool opening event, I doubt they will have it again though.</p>
