<p>On the Sunday we got the Kuranda Scenic Railway up to visit our friend Jaimee in Kuranda.</p>
<p>Was a slow train, but a nice journey and impressive to think about the effort that was involved in constructing it.</p>

<p>Barron Gorge was a bit disappointing after seeing photos of it in flood about 2 weeks earlier.
But still nice that the train stops for 10mins to have a look.</p>

<p>Kuranda itself was nice, lots of markets and food places.</p>

<p>The Skyrail back was much cooler than the train, as you get to look down on the rainforest.</p>

<p>There was another stop to look at Barron Gorge, which was cooler from the other side as we saw the train come in on it&#39;s way back down.</p>

<p>There was a 2nd Skyrail stop where a guide talked about some of the plants along a boardwalk, which was also really good.</p>

<p>At the bottom there was a waterskiing park, which was cool to watch from the Gondola.</p>

<p>That afternoon, Rachael&#39;s uncle recommended we visit <a href="http://www.cairns.catholic.org.au/documents/peacewindows.html">St Monica&#39;s Cathedral</a> to see the stained glass windows. They were by far the best stained glass windows I have seen in a church, awesome to see fish and space rather than the typical themes and well worth a visit.</p>
