<p>Part of thinking of names for a child is deciding on which surname to use. There are lots of different ways of choosing surnames other than the modern English way of taking the paternal one. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surname">wiki page on surnames</a> is supringly detailed.</p>
<p>After having a unique name like Guinane, I didn't want Newman as a surname because it's too common. Looking at <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/2000_surnames.html">US Census Data</a> it's not actually as highly ranked as I was expecting, but still a lot more popular then Guinane.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Rank</th><th>Count</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>NEWMAN</td><td>273</td><td>100,491</td></tr>
<tr><td>NEUMANN</td><td>1,992</td><td>16,697</td></tr>
<tr><td>GUINAN</td><td>16,571</td><td>1,595</td></tr>
<tr><td>GUINANE</td><td>69,428</td><td>264</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>I also don't think the story behind Newman is particularly inspiring given it just means that you are the new man in town.</p>
<p>Rachael didn't want to follow the patriarchy and use Guinane or that everybody has trouble trying to spell it. My g-g-grandfather (who the name comes from) moved to Australia from Ireland and  <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/57273677">didn't even know how to spell it</a> - as most Catholics in Ireland in the mid 1800s were illiterate.</p>

<p>Neither of us liked the idea of Guinane-Newman. I really wanted for us to come up with a completely new name, and we both liked the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_blending">name blending</a>. So about a month ago Rachael and I changed our surnames to Guinman - which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> of Newman and Guinane.</p>
