<p>After Eungella, we stayed the night at Seaforth. There wasn't a whole lot there.
We got fish &amp; chips for dinner, and instead of seagulls they had curlews that bug you for some instead!</p>

<p>They get really big tides there as well, so the swimming net was kind of pointless if it is not high tide.</p>

<p>We got recommended going to Cape Hillsborough at sunrise to see the kangaroos and wallabies feeding on the beach. There was a bunch of people there and the tour guide fed them, but was a very nice sunrise.</p>

<p>The hike itself also was quite nice, and had some nice views.</p>

<p>We didn&#39;t quite make it to the last few lookouts as there was a giant spider across the path which put Rachael off.</p>

<p>On our way up to Townsville, we stopped at Bowen for lunch.</p>

<p>We got subway for lunch and went to Horseshoe Bay to eat it.
It was a really nice beach, with lots of people in swimming despite being stinger season. There was a nice lookout walk but it was super hot so we left it for the drive back.</p>

<p>From there we drove on to Townsville, went for a walk along the esplanade and
went to The Palmetum which was a nice gardens we didn&#39;t get to last time we visited.</p>
