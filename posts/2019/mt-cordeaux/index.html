<p>A few guys from work and I did the Mount Cordeaux/Bare Rock track
in <a href="https://parks.des.qld.gov.au/parks/main-range/about.html#tracks_from_cunninghams_gap">Main Range National Park</a>.</p>
<p>Rachael and I had done the short Rainforest circuit at the start of the track on the way back from Boonah a few years ago. From here the hike up was mostly through rainforest and not to steep.</p>

<p>At Mt Cordeax there was a nice lookout back towards Lake Moogerah.</p>

<p>It then continues on a little bit further on Bare Rock track to another lookout.</p>

<p>It was a nice clear day so you could make out the Brisbane skyline reasonably clearly, although getting it to show up on a photo was harder.</p>

<p>It took us <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2285382444">about 2.5 hours</a> return, and was a great short little hike to start off the weekend.</p>
