  Energy Consumption Data

<p class="subtitle"><strong>2019-10-26</strong></p>



<p>When we moved into our house it had an old accumulation meter (read every 3 months) that was probably put in when the house was built (as it was apparently installed by the <em>Toowoomba Electric Light &amp; Power Company</em>).</p>

<p>We got a &#39;smart&#39; meter installed a few years ago. Unfortunately there is no way to get access to the data from it directly, so you can&#39;t really use it to do home automation or anything useful in real-time.</p>
<p>You can request your interval data from <a href="https://www.ergon.com.au/network/connections/metering/accessing-your-metering-data">Ergon</a> or <a href="https://www.energex.com.au/home/our-services/meters/accessing-your-metering-data">Energex</a> up to 4 times a year. This allows you to do some analysis and charting of your energy usage at least. Here is a <a href="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2019/energy-data/xxxxxxxxxx_20170701_20180630_20180906143230_ERGONETP_DETAILED.csv">link to my data</a> for the 2017-18 financial year with my NMI redacted.</p>
<p>When you look at daily consumption it&#39;s suprisingly easy to tell when we were away on holidays. We went to Rocky four times in the first half of 2018 and it&#39;s really easy to make these longer dips in energy usage out. There are a few shorter dips that represent weekend trips to Brisbane or the coast. You can also pick out really hot or cold days which have large spikes from the air-con.</p>

<p>It&#39;s even more apparent when you zoom in on the energy usage of a day when were away.</p>
<p><img src="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2019/energy-data/energy-not-home.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /></p>
<p>It&#39;s basically no usage except for the refrigerator compressor kicking in every now and then. Compare this to a cold workday where you can see a big spike when the heater was running before work and then afternoon usage when we got home from work.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t a particularly hot year in Toowoomba, so our average profile had a clear winter morning peak and then generally consistent afternoon peak throughout the year.</p>

<p>Since Rachael was working a rotating roster there wasn&#39;t a huge difference between weekends/weekdays either.</p>
<p><img src="https://alex.guinman.id.au/posts/2019/energy-data/energy-workday.jpg" alt="&quot;workday usage&quot;" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /></p>
<p>It was also interesting to compare what we would have paid on different tariffs over the year. Since we have gas hot water we don&#39;t actually use that much energy and so discounts on the kwh rate didn&#39;t make a huge difference. The price was mostly driven by the daily charges that you pay no matter what. I was suprised that Tariff 12 (Time of Use) was slightly cheaper, but saving $13 a year is probably not worth having to worry about what time of day we use energy.</p>

<p>The SEQ retailers also seemed to be way more expensive, although that doesn&#39;t factor in the discounts and sign-up bonuses they offer.</p>
