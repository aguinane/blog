<p>It was great to go to be able to go to the food and wine festival again this year, after last year was cancelled and we had a newborn the year before that. Unfortunately they had to change the lineup last minute due to border closures, so it was mostly bands I'd already seen several times.</p>

<p>Lyra really liked the dinosaur theme at Laurel Bank Park this year.</p>

<p>We even went to the parade for probably the first time <a href="/posts/2012/tcof-parade/">since the we moved here</a>. It wasn&#39;t much different, but Lyra really enjoyed it.</p>
