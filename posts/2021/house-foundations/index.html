<p>Before Christmas they started doing the earthworks and retaining wall at the back of the block.</p>

<p>We also had to pick all our selections before Christmas.
It wasn&#39;t actually too bad as the interior designer had a showroom with most of the selections to choose from. And then we had to go to a couple of other stores like Tradelink for a few other selections but overall much simpler then I expected.</p>

<p>And finally they started the slab on Australia Day.
So should be much easier to start planning our landscaping and stuff now that we have a good idea of how much space the house will take up.</p>
