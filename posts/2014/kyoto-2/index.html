<p>So I&#39;ll jump a head a little bit and talk about our day trip to Tokyo. From Hakuba we got a bullet train to Osaka where we were staying, but the following day we did a day trip to Kyoto while our JR pass was still valid.</p>
<p>First up, we went to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fushimi_Inari-taisha">Fushimi Inari-taisha</a> a temple built for the Shintu god of rice, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inari_%C5%8Ckami">Inari</a>. It started out a bit disappointing, as it was much like the other temples we had been to... but then it just kept going. There is a walk up the hill to a lookout and there are just gates the whole way, the amount of work that would have been involved is incredible. I really enjoyed it, although I think everyone else was put off by the fact that involved lots of walking up stairs and it really did seem endless.</p>
<p>By the time we had walked back to the bottom, everyone else was tired so it was decided we would go back to main train station to find lunch. I was happy to keep wandering until we found some lunch on the way to the next site but was outvoted. We had a really good lunch, but by the time we got to the next place I wanted to look at, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanj%C5%ABsangen-d%C5%8D">Sanjūsangen-dō</a>, it was closed. Likewise there was a few museums nearby but they were all closed for renovations as well. I guess winter is not a popular time for tourists so everything shuts early or is just closed in general.</p>
<p>It was a bit of a bummer and after that we got a train back to Osaka.</p>
