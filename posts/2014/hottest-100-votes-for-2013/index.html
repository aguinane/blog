<p>Yet another year where I was slack with listening to new music. On the other hand, I did get to go to a fair few live gigs throughout the year. The Spotted Cow has been good for that, hopefully they have just as many bands come through this year. Yet again I tied to keep one vote per artist, which meant that a couple of like a versions made it in. I&#39;m picking Get Lucky or Royals for #1, but Giorgio By Moroder and Team beat them out when I was deciding what sounded better tonight. Perhaps that&#39;s just due to overplaying.</p>
<p>My votes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Daft Punk - Giorgio By Moroder</li>
<li>Lorde - Team</li>
<li>Franz Ferdinand - Love Illumination</li>
<li>Illy - Ausmusic Month Medley {Like A Version}</li>
<li>Tame Impala - Prototype {Like A Version}</li>
<li>Abbe May - Pony {Like A Version}</li>
<li>Hungry Kids Of Hungary - Do Or Die</li>
<li>Bluejuice - S.O.S.</li>
<li>Haim - Falling</li>
<li>The Cat Empire - Prophets in the Sky</li>
</ul>
