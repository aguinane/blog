<p>So after the MRH90 Simulator tour I was pretty keen for the <a href="https://cardboard.withgoogle.com/">Google Cardboard</a> that I ordered several weeks ago <a href="http://www.tinydeal.com/diy-google-cardboard-vr-3d-glasses-for-iphone-samsung-cellphone-p-135220.html">on sale</a> to show up. It ended up costing $7.50 or something for 2 of them delivered.</p>
<p>It showed up on Wednesday and is pretty awesome. You install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.samples.apps.cardboarddemo">an app</a> on your phone that uses the gyroscope to detect your head moving, and has a split screen that turns to 3d when you look through the lenses. The lenses from our cheap Chinese version aren&#39;t great so you get sore eyes after using it for a few minutes.</p>
<p>The actual demo apps themselves are incredibly trippy though. The coolest one was the 3D google earth which allowed you to fly around similar to a flight simulator. It&#39;s not as cool as the army one, but $4 is a lot cheaper then $70 million. I can&#39;t wait until you the prices of the Occulus Rift comes down and you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RehCTRrWM0">do stuff like this</a>.</p>
