<p>So we finally were able to go on our 2nd ski holiday now that Rachael got the bug in Japan, this time to New Zealand.</p>
<p>We flew into Queenstown for a night, and then mum and dad met us later in Wanaka the next day. Rachael was impressed from the get go but the first day was a bit of a miserable rainy day and not as good as last time I was there. The sun came out on the 2nd day though before we headed off to Wanaka for the main reason of our trip, snow sports!</p>

<p>The Queenstown Gardens had a disc golf course, something I had never heard of before but sounds super fun. We also went to <a href="http://www.ivanclarkegallery.com/gallery_directory.html">Ivan Clarke Gallery</a> which was free and had lots of awesome paintings of cartoon dogs.</p>

<p>After skiing in Wanaka, we came back to Queenstown with Mum &amp; Dad and went up the Gondola to do some luge. We wanted to do luge the last time I went but we didn&#39;t have time. It was pretty fun and there was an awesome backdrop. We got some videos as well which I will sort through later.</p>

<p>We saw a goat and it&#39;s &#39;kid&#39; while up there and they also had some cool jelly bean art. I made sure to revisit the Fergburger and see if it lived up to the memory, and it was just as tasty as I remembered. Rachael got the Codfather but it wasn&#39;t as good as the classic Ferg.</p>

<p>We did a day tour to Milford Sound and then picked up a rental car to drive to Christchurch.</p>
