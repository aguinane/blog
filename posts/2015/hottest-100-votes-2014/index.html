<p><strong>Saskwatch - Born To Break Your Heart</strong>
I saw Saskwatch live at the carnival of flowers, and despite being cold and raining and not knowing any of their songs, we stayed for the full set. Don&#39;t Want To Try was my favourite song, but since it wasn&#39;t released last year this is my pick. Love the horns.</p>
<p><strong>Bluejuice - I&#39;ll Go Crazy</strong>
A great band, sad that they are calling it quits.</p>
<p><strong>The Grates - Wish I Was Alone</strong>
Not the greatest Grates song, but we were the first in the world to hear it live at their Toowoomba show, so it gets a spot.</p>
<p><strong>Dustin Tebbutt - Bones</strong>
Another song I saw live when they were supporting Missy Higgins. The set nearly put us to sleep, as it&#39;s not exactly upbeat music and we had had a massive day. But a great song regardless.</p>
<p><strong>Ball Park Music - Trippin&#39; The Light Fantastic</strong>
Their cover of Diane Young was good too.</p>
<p><strong>Chet Faker - Talk Is Cheap</strong></p>
<p><strong>Flight Facilities - Sunshine {Ft. Reggie Watts}</strong></p>
<p><strong>Asgeir - Kings and Cross</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hilltop Hoods - Cosby Sweater</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Griswalds - Beware The Dog</strong></p>
<p>Some other songs from my short list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Megan Washington - Who Are You_</li>
<li>TV On The Radio - Happy Idiot_</li>
<li>Sia - Chandelier_</li>
<li>Peking Duk - Take Me Over {Ft. SAFIA}_</li>
<li>King Gizzard &amp; The Lizard Wizard - Cellophane_</li>
<li>Matt Corby - What The Devil Has Made_</li>
<li>Lana Del Rey - West Coast_</li>
<li>Jack White - Lazeretto_</li>
<li>alt-J - Every Other Freckle_</li>
<li>The Holidays - Is This How You Feel? (Like A Version)_</li>

</ul>
