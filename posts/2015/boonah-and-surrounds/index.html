<p>Rachael is doing her final nursing placement in <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Boonah+QLD+4310/">Boonah</a>. So prior to the placement we went for a drive to see what the town and surrounding areas were like last October.</p>
<p>The drive through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunninghams_Gap">Cunningham&#39;s Gap</a> is spectacular. The western side is rainforest, and the eastern side provides views of some really steep sections of the great dividing range. There is a nice rainforest walk at the very top, but unfortunately the lookout that you walk to doesn&#39;t have a very good view.</p>

<p>On our first trip we found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moogerah_Peaks_National_Park">Lake Moogerah</a>, which you are allowed to swim in. It was a stinking hot day and we didn&#39;t bring togs so we made sure we did the next time, but unfortunately the water wasn&#39;t as inviting the second time.</p>

<p>We tried to take a scenic way back to Toowoomba through Spicer&#39;s Gap and see <a href="http://www.nprsr.qld.gov.au/parks/main-range/about.html#tracks_around_spicers_gap">Governor&#39;s Chair Lookout</a> but the road is actually closed to cars at the top and so you can&#39;t drive through. It was a good lookout, but the road was very steep and dangerous especially in a Yarris (and not a 4WD) and so it wasn&#39;t really worth the effort, as you have to backtrack back down.</p>
<p>Boonah itself wasn&#39;t all that exciting, although the area is full of rolling green hills which are pretty nice.</p>
