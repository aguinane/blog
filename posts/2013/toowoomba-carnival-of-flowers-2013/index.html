<p>We went to the carnival of flowers again this year with the wine festival having another good line up of bands. This included The Whitlams, who I have wanted to see for ages. Unfortunately, the good line-up meant that they sold way more tickets than they were expecting and the place was packed. It was so busy you couldn&#39;t even make your way around to the food and wine stands, as to get any where you needed to squish your way through the crowd at a snail&#39;s pace to go anywhere. All the bands were quite good though, especially The Whitlams. The Sunday night was a bit less crowded and dad and I got to sample some wines. We found an awesome Strawberry wine, and talked to a guy that is working on a Lichee Cider.</p>

<p>On the Sunday night Dragon played, but with a different lead singer it was basically like watching a cover band. The Commitments were surprisingly good, despite not knowing many of their songs they were a super punch big band and really enjoyable.</p>
<p>The council gardens looked just as good as last year, but despite different patterns were mostly the same. There was some new private gardens though. Particularly cool was a garden at a house overlooking the range called &quot;Fairy Land&quot;. The amount of work that would have gone into it is phenomenal.</p>
