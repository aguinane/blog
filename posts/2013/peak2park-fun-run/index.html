<p>Today Rachael and I went in the Peak2Park fun run from Picnic Point to Lake Annand. The weather was pretty terrible, cold, foggy and rainy. The amount of people there was impressive though, I didn&#39;t expect so many people to turn up.</p>
<p>We didn&#39;t think to take a photo with our bibs on until after we got home (right). I did the 10km run in a time of <a href="http://app.strava.com/activities/42854171#721718071">56:50</a> (on the clock), and Rachael did the 4km (actually 5km according to her Strava recording) in a time of <a href="http://app.strava.com/activities/42869409#721988626">34:42</a> (from Strava).</p>
<p>I&#39;m very impressed with Rachael&#39;s time, I saw her cross the finish line and she looked about ready to die. I did very little training but she did zero, so quite quick considering.</p>
