<p>Last night we went to check out the <a href="http://www.christmaswonderland.com.au">Christmas lights at Queen&#39;s Park</a>. It was pretty much the same as last year, but I took some photos this time around.</p>
<p>We went to check out <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/d3fXF">Audrey Ct</a> as well, which we were told had some good lights. We were not expecting them to be as good as they were, almost every house in the street had put up a crazy amount of lights. I wouldn&#39;t want to live there this time of year with the number of cars driving past at 9:00pm on Sunday night when we went. Very impressive.</p>
