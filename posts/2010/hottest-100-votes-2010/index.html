<p>Having looked at people&#39;s votes coming in for the Hottest 100, it is really clear to me that I have been away a long time. While I know most of the bands, I have never heard of a lot of the songs people are voting for. Rachael has impressed me this year by voting and has picked some good songs that I had not heard of before. Before we started going out she didn&#39;t even listen to triple J and now she is more up with the music then me.</p>
<p>Usually I find it extremely hard to narrow my list down to only 10 votes, but this year I found the opposite. It was hard for me to pick 10 stand-out songs from the year. I have been away for half the year, so I thought it would be fitting if I narrow it down to my top 5 instead. I am sure there are plenty of great songs that better deserved my vote, and I am looking forward to hearing them all in January and catching up with the last half-year of music.</p>
<p><strong>OK Go - End Love</strong>
Greatest <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2fpgpanZAw">music video</a> of the year, second only to the This Too Shall Pass video. Even without the video accompanying it, the song is incredibly catchy and makes me happy when I hear it.</p>
<p><strong>Murray Gold &amp; the BBC National Orchestra of Wales - I am the Doctor</strong>
I don&#39;t even know who Freya Elizabeth from Kyu is, but she listed this as her favourite song of 2010 in the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100/10/toptens/">celebrity list</a>. While I wouldn&#39;t have even considered it if I hadn&#39;t have seen her list, it&#39;s a crazy suspense-building song that reminds me of the show - so it gets a place.</p>
<p><strong>Pendulum - ABC Theme (Remix)</strong>
I always love hearing the JJJ news theme. I was at a party in ZÃ¼rich and Asako (from Australia) had JJJ streaming in the background. I wasn&#39;t paying much attention but then they played the news theme - something I could recognis anywhere - and it was a nice reminder of home. I don&#39;t mind the ABC news theme either, but I never would I have thought that someone could make a song out of it. A bloody cool one at that.</p>
<p><strong>The Cat Empire - Call Me Home</strong>
I don&#39;t think I have ever disliked a Cat Empire album. Each release is less impressive to me than the last, but I still enjoy every song to some extent. I have wanted to see the Cat Empire live for years, and I finally saw them in Munich in October, incredibly hungover after a big day at Oktoberfest. This was their final song..... and it was incredible.</p>
<p><strong>The Temper Trap - Resurrection (Penguin Prison Remix)</strong>
Leading up to and well after the Big Day Out, my most played album was by far Conditions by The Temper Trap. They were absolutely amazing live and I am in love with every song on the album. I voted for them last year, but I am voting again this year for remixed version of Resurrection. The whole album <a href="http://soundcloud.com/the-temper-trap/sets/conditions-remixed">has been remixed</a> but this is the only one I have really listened to. I wouldn&#39;t go as far as to say it&#39;s better than the original, but it gives it a new feel and had me listening to it all over again. So this Remix gets my final vote.</p>
