<p>Whilst aimlessly walking around the city, I saw in tiny writing on the door that one building was a museum, so had a mosey inside.</p>
<p>There wasn&#39;t anything particularly special in it, but was definitely worth looking around. It was mostly filled with life-like animal displays, which looked like they were stuffed versions of the real thing, but I&#39;m not sure if they all were. It also made it hard to understand what I was looking at sometimes, when all the information was in German.</p>
<p>There was a few cool displays though.</p>
<p>There was a few skeleton&#39;s and fossil&#39;s which were interesting...</p>

<p>And they had a microscope set up which you could move around and look at these eggs up-close. A really cool idea, but I didn&#39;t find them much more interesting when magnified.</p>

<p>They also had a giant ant-farm. I saw 2 that were making a break for it and had escaped, but that&#39;s still a pretty good design that only 2 had escaped when all the tops are open. You couldn&#39;t really see too well in the nest, and couldn&#39;t see any eggs or larvae or anything. There was cabinet underneath that was locked which I assume they can open up and you can look at it on tours or something.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t know what this is, but it&#39;s a freaking huge, scary-looking bug that could probably take a large chunk out of you.</p>

<p>There was corridor made out of mirrors that was incredibly trippy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming this represents blood diamonds? They had some really cool looking rocks, with some crazy formations.</p>
