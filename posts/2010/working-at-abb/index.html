<p>So some people weren&#39;t sure if I&#39;d actually started work yet, so thought I would do a post about where I&#39;m working. I started on Thursday 1 July and finish on the 31 December.</p>
<p>So far I have mostly been reading about Simulink and the project I will be working on and settling in. Tomorrow and Friday I am doing a training course.</p>
<p>Work itself seems like it will be very interesting and should be fun. ABB&#39;s official language is English, so most of the documentation and stuff is in English - but they have German keyboards with the z and y keys swapped around which keeps stuffing me up, and most of the signage and news and stuff up around the office is in German.</p>
<p>As English is the official language, everybody speaks it pretty well, although most people seem to talk in German when they can, but will speak in English when talking to me.</p>
<p>I work in the third floor of this building (although I will be working in the lab later on).</p>

<p>The office has <em>actual</em> plants in it, not plastic ones like Ergon. And I&#39;m promised that I will get some dual screen monitor action soon for my laptop.</p>

<p>At 12.30 everybody goes to lunch at the ABB restaurant. The menu is in German, but they have the meals on display so you can see what they look like. They have a different menu each day, <a href="http://aubruecke.sv-group.ch/de.html">and put it on the net</a>.</p>
<p>So far the meals have been pretty nice, there was one that was pretty average. At least I get to try a different meal each day, and they are different to what you would probably get in Australia. Meat over here is expensive as, so there isn&#39;t much actual meat in the meals :(</p>
