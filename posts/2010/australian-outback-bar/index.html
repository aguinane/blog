<p>I went to the Australian Outback Bar in ZÃ¼rich tonight for the IAESTE weekly Meeting. It was both cool and disappointing. Cool in that they didn&#39;t just have Fosters, they had Bundy Rum, VB and Coopers. Not cool that it was like 8sFr for a VB and 15sFr for a Rum and Coke. Also their menu had prawns listed as shrimp ...</p>
<p>There was XXXX signs as well, but they didn&#39;t sell it, which is false advertising I reckon. Asako got a burger which looked reasonably Australian, despite having no beetroot. I asked her if it tasted like home, and she said that it did, so at least they can be proud of that.</p>
<p>Two of Kirsty&#39;s British friends came as well, one of which was a Mumford, as in the cousin of the Mumford &amp; Sons, which is pretty cool.</p>
<p>There was a map of Australia on the ceiling that had Rockhampton shown, so I got to show everyone where it was. They were pretty impressed that it got a mention, as they didn&#39;t think it would be important enough to be on a map if it only has a population of 60,000 or so.</p>
