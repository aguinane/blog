<p>I&#39;ve seen enough signs since being here to work out that Wanderweg means that there is a walking path this way, or the yellow diamond painted on to a tree like in the next photo. Just used google translate and the word actually translates to &quot;trail&quot; but I got the idea.</p>

<p>So next weekend I am doing a Rafting/Hiking weekend and it said that you need to bring hiking shoes, so yesterday I went in to the closest big shopping centre in Spreitenbach to buy some. That&#39;s actually the town I ended up at after walking home after Zurich Fest.</p>
<p>So after I bought some I decided I go for a walk up the mountain behind Turgi, as I noticed a Wanderweg sign at the train station pointing that way.</p>
<p>It was actually a really hard climb, quite steep and a very narrow path. It was quite a hot day too, so it wasn&#39;t easy going. The view from the top was quite good though, as you could see all of Turgi and Brugg and see the Limmat river.</p>

<p>There was also some weird rocks formation things along the way, with a really big one up the top that was like a cave. Here&#39;s the pictures anyways so you can look for yourself.</p>
