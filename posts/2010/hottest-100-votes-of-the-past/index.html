  Hottest 100 Votes of the Past

<p>As it comes once again to Hottest 100 voting time, this year I think I am unqualified to vote. Having been overseas for 6 months, I have not been keeping up with the music released in Australia and popular post-June. On the other hand I am happy that the list this year will provide me with lots of new music to listen to. But before I start to look at what I am going to vote for, I wanted to look back on what I voted for in the past. The first time I voted was in 2003, and my pick for number 1 was &quot;I Love Work&quot; although I was happy enough with Seven Nation Army and Hey Ya taking out the top 2 spots. In that year I didn&#39;t even use up the full 10 votes you are allowed, I think I only used 7. In years after that I took it much more seriously and always used my ten votes carefully.</p>
<p>So I am going to try and find copies of my lists from past years, although this could prove an impossible task. I posted my votes somewhere each year, but 6 years ago was before Facebook and the posts from my Myspace account are long since deleted. I will update this post then with my past votes as I find them (if I find them).</p>

<p>This is the 10 songs that I voted for in the Hottest 100 of all time.

<li>Missy Higgins - Warm Whispers</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-3">2006</h2>
<ul>
<li>&#39;Til The End - The Living End
Have to vote for Living End of course. They have had a song in the countdown since 1997. They were awesome live! Chose this song over Long Live The Weekend and Wake Up, also good songs.</li>
<li>This Bed - Kisschasy
There albulm actually came out like 2 years ago now I think, but anyway. It was in the list of songs you can vote for so why not. The shake was also on the list, but this is better.</li>
<li>Call Me Anytime - The Cops
Only just came out, so haven&#39;t given it a chance to get annoying yet, but so far I still love it.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t You Think It&#39;s Time - Bob Evans
This song sounds really nice, even if the Harmonica riff is a rip-off of a Billy Joel song. ALMOST voted for Nowhere Without You instead, another great song.</li>
<li>Changing Emily - Special Patrol
I really have no idea why I like this song. I just do.</li>
<li>Distance - Ellington
This vote is kinda a waste, cause they have no chance of getting in the list. But I love this song. It&#39;s Rohan&#39;s cousins band (he told me to download). There other EP songs are good too, but not as good as distance.</li>
<li>Starlight - Muse</li>
<li>Black Fingernails, Red Wine - Eskimo Joe
Hmm, not there best album. But the chorus still makes this a good catchy song.</li>
<li>Here It Goes Again - OK Go
Perhaps not the greatest song in the world, but the video clip more than compensates for any doubt in whether it should get a vote.</li>
<li>When You Were Young - The Killers
Despite the fact that it was on Sarah&#39;s So Fresh CD, this is still a good song.</li>
</ul>
<p>Honourable Mentions.......</p>
<ul>
<li>One Crowded Hour - Augie March</li>

<li>The Others - Dukes Of Windsor</li>
<li>Hearts A Mess - Gotye</li>
