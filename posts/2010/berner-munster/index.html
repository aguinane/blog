<p>While in Bern, I went inside this amazing looking church, The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnster_of_Bern">M端nster of Bern</a>. It really looked amazing inside, and was just so huge.</p>

<p>It took me a while to work out how to get up the tower - you had to pay 4CHF then there was a little tiny door that lead up a really skinny staircase that took you to the top - but there was an amazing view of the city from the top.</p>
<p>The staircase was really small, and it was quite high. They added a fair bit of bars on the windows and stuff for safety, but it would have been incredibly scary building the thing.</p>

<p>The photo&#39;s don&#39;t really give it justice but I&#39;m sure you can imagine what it was like. There are clearer photo&#39;s on the wiki page I linked above as well.</p>
