<p>The flight was extremely long, and horribly uncomfortable. Thai airways was an awesome airline though, everything was very schmick but it didn&#39;t change the fact that you had to sit in the same spot for 8 hours.</p>
<p>Bangkok airport was pretty cool, the place was massive. As it was night time it was hard to tell how big exactly since you couldn&#39;t see outside, but it seemed to go on forever. Also they had stores selling elephant tusks, which I thought was frowned upon, but I guess not.</p>
<p>The flight with Swiss Airways wasn&#39;t as fancy but I spent most of it trying to sleep so it wasn&#39;t a huge deal.</p>
<p>Zurich airport was pretty cool too. They had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skymetro">train between terminals</a> and they had all these posters along the track which, because we were going so fast, made stop-motion videos of a lady waving a Swiss flag.</p>
<p>Getting through customs was easy too, they didn&#39;t even check our bags, just the passport. From the airport I got a train to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich_Hauptbahnhof">ZÃ¼rich Hauptbahnhof</a>, then on to Turgi, where I walked across to ABB and got shown to my accommodation.</p>
