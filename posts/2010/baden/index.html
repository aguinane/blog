<p>So after work on Friday I thought I would see what the closest town (Baden) is like.
It is much bigger than Turgi, with a lot of shops and stuff, it even had a McDonalds and Burger King. The buildings there are all look amazing though, and all the streets are cobblestone.</p>

<p>The river passes through here as well, and there was three guys jumping into it then swimming across into a calm section (before being taken away by the current). It looked really fun.
