<p>The other day I tried to make a snowman but the snow was glorious powder and didn&#39;t want to stick together. Today it was (according to the Internet) 1Â°C and the snow was starting to melt a little bit. Now that it was a bit melted I used the last chance I had before it melts away completely to attempt to make one before I go home.</p>
<p>Making a snowman is HARD WORK. The process was pretty simple, just make a ball to start with then roll it around, but once it gets a bit bigger it gets REALLY HEAVY. I wanted to make it life-size so just kept going until it was too heavy to push anymore. I was pretty happy with the base so then I made another for the next part.</p>
<p>Once I had pushed it up to the base, I realised something. This thing was hard to push so it was going to be really hard to lift. Attempting to lift it achieved nothing. I tried a few different things but eventually got it up on a chair... well half of it. If you look at the photos you will see that when I lifted it up the ball broke in half. In any case it was up, and I was pretty happy and exhausted. From then on it was easy again, trying to re-attach the parts that fell off and make it more round looking. You can see in the photo above the final product.</p>
<p>The snow was already starting to melt in the afternoon, so I don&#39;t think it will make it through tomorrow. Now the sun is down it&#39;s a bit colder again so it least it will make it through the night. If it starts to melt tomorrow I&#39;m not sure if I should wait and see how long it can last or put it out of its misery and kick it&#39;s head off. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a common thing to do over here but when it was finished I pictured someone stomping on a sandcastle and wondered if they did the same thing with snowmen.</p>
