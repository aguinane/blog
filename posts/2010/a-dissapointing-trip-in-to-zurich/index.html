<p>Today I went to Zürich with Anthony to <a href="http://www.sackmesserkult.ch/veranstaltungen_e.html">make my own pocketknife</a> at the Landesmuseum, but when we got there they told us they were totally booked up for the whole day, so we couldn&#39;t :(</p>
<p>So we walked around the city in the rain for a bit, but nothing too exciting. There really isn&#39;t too much to see in Zürich in comparison to some of the other places around. And especially when it&#39;s raining.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://plus.google.com/110750135298275838032/">Grossmünster</a> did have some cool stained-glass windows though (above). Rather than just using glass they had all these cool gemstone things. It said no photography allowed, but I took some photos anyway. The view from the top of the tower was okay as well, but climbing the tower at Bern and Basel were better.</p>
<p>In the end the rain got to us, so we went home early, forgoing the option of free transport after 7 with the Gleis7 and paying to go home at around 2.</p>
