  Snow!

<p class="subtitle"><strong>2010-11-24</strong></p>



<p>It snowed today! For about 5 minutes anyway. The weather had predicted snow for today, but when I woke up in the morning I was disappointed to see that there was none. Then at work I looked out the window at one stage in the morning, and noticed IT WAS SNOWING! After a few minutes when it stopped there was no indication that it had snowed at all :( Once the clouds cleared a bit you could see the trees on the very top of the hill were snow-capped, but about 15 minutes later that was gone too.</p>
<p>There is more snow predicted on Friday. It doesn't matter that much though as I'll probably go into the mountains this weekend with my housemates to go snowboarding. So lots more snow to come.</p>
