<p>I'm staying at a 4 bedroom apartment at: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/dyhCfB9MG2F2">Spinnereistrasse 4, CH-5300 Turgi</a></p>
<p>I'm sharing with 3 other people, a guy from Poland, a girl from Germany and a guy from Czech Republic. When I first arrived there was a guy from Germany here too (Jan), but he was only staying the weekend.</p>

<p>The apartment is pretty sweet, a photo of my room is above. And then there is 2 bathrooms and a shared kitchen/living room:</p>

<p>And outside is pretty cool too, there is a little deck sort of thing and backyard:

<p>From the apartment it&#39;s just a short walk to work, across this cool bridge:

<p>Oh and the key for the apartment is the most intense key I have ever seen:
