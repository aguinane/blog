<p>We were on morning watch and everyone was still pretty depressed and sick. I had another go on the helm and found it much easier second time round. Those of us that felt up to it (Elke, Rob and I - Scott despite being fine the night before was probably the sickest in the morning) climbed up with Paul to watch the sunrise.</p>
<p>Shortly after our watch we changed course, heading south towards Jervis Bay and instantly I felt better as we were no longer working against the swell and the rocking wasn't as severe. I was able to go down below and have lunch and unlike the previous meals most people ate. There was still a few people that were pretty sick but most people had there sea legs by this stage and were cheery again.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we had a lecture from our Nav Matt about navigation skills.</p>
<p>After dinner, those of us from White Watch went pretty much straight to bed as tonight we had "The Guts" which is the watch from 12 -4.</p>
