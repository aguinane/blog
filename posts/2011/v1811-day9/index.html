<p>As I mentioned earlier, every morning the staff held a morning brief. One of our command day tasks was to host our own. Rick was our Nanna, Ash gave the long winded Nav talk, and I was Salty Seadog with the help of my assistant Emma.

<p>To show of our newly learned knot-tying skills - one task was to build a Hammock that could support the entire youth crew:

<p>When our 24 hours were up, the crew assessed how we had met each task. They deemed all tasks completed - even navigation was awarded since the wind dropped and made it pretty much impossible.</p>
<p>We had a debrief of command day, and went ashore with our watch leaders to discuss whether we had met all the goals we had set ourselves at the start of the journey.</p>
<p>It was Bec&#39;s 21st the day after we berthed, so we decided to throw her an early party so she could say she had a birthday party on a multimillion dollar yacht. Emma bought decorations from the IGA while we were ashore.
