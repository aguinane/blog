<p>So the reason why I had so much trouble getting home was because of the floods. So here are some photos and links about it.</p>
<p>This is why my flight was cancelled (it got higher than that):

<p>And NASA had some satellite images that show just how much water there was during and after:

<p>NASA source link <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=48916">here</a> and <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=48456&amp;src=iotdrss">here</a>.</p>
<p>With the airport underwater and the highway and railway closed to the south, it cut down my transport options, but it wasn&#39;t completely isolated like the media said. You could still get in through from the north through Mackay, or by boat from Gladstone on the Freedom Fast Cats like I did.</p>
