<p>On our last full day, we had a half day sail with local people with disabilities. It was very rewarding, although we went out past the heads so they could see some whales (we saw several) which caused a lot of them to get seasick.</p>
<p>I was part of the Youth Crew Theatre Crew, and we dressed up in the ship costumes and performed our nursery rhyme style shanties for the guests.</p>
<p>That night we were tasked with creating a poster for our watch to go in the ship logs. I spent ages going through the past posters throughout the journey but couldn&#39;t find Rachael, David or Katherine&#39;s photos.</p>
<p>We also got to write letters to our future selves, which will be posted to us 6 months later. Since I have been so slack with updating this blog, that letter should be only 3 months away now.</p>
